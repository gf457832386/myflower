The problem is that the car has \naftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather\nweak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.\n\nThe inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get a\nwaiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the\nofficer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a\nwaiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to\nshow me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  He\nshowed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if\nyou can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told\nhim that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book\nand said \"It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you\na ticket for it right now.\" Well, won't argue with that...\n\nSince the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the\ntint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in the\nlibrary).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police\nthat says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won't\nget in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registering\na complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.\n\nSo does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from\nthe police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience\nregistering a complaint against an officer? I called the station \nlater on today, but they basically said there is no place where I\ncould register a complaint against an officer...

In the\nfollowing verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon\nthe Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  If you'll notice, He\nalso reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived\ninterpretations.  They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their\nheads but not their hearts.  That is why He points out that our righteousness\nmust surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom\nof Heaven.  People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their\nway to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin.\nThey had become legalistic, rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced the\nletter of the Law but never really believed in it.  \n\nI think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of\nmodern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe\nin it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?\n\nChristianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's\nperspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.\nSome people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is their\nchoice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.\n\nGod be with you,", "label": 19}

In addition, 30 to 40 percent are left running\nat night and on weekends.\n\nComputer equipment is now the fastest growing private-sector use\nof electricity.  Computers alone are believed to account for five\npercent of commercial electricity consumption, and may account for\nten percent by the year 2000.\n\nIf you are one of those who leave them on after you're done, it\nwould be a big environmental benefit if you would just TURN IT OFF\nwhen you're not using it.  It only takes a second or two to do.\n\nAlso, the majority of the power your computer uses is not consumed\nby the computer itself, but by the monitor.  If you can't turn the\ncomputer off, then please just TURN OFF THE MONITOR.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has formed an alliance\nwith computer manufacturers to promote the introduction of energy-\nefficient PCs that \"power down\" automatically when not being used\nand thus reduce the air pollution caused by power generation.  These\nnew computers will save enough electricity to power both Vermont and\nNew Hampshire and save up to 1 billion U.S. dollars in annual\nelectricity bills.  Look for the special EPA \"Energy Star\" logo when\nyou buy computers.  They should be available in one to two years.\n\nAccording to the EPA studies, the energy saved will prevent CO2\nemissions of 20 million tons annually, the equivalent of five million\nautomobiles.  Also, 140,000 tons of SO2 and 75,000 tons of nitrogen\noxide emissions will be saved; these are the major pollutants\nresponsible for acid rain.\n\nPlease do your part ... be responsible.

I moved there from\nNovosibirsk. My son entered the Baku Nautical School, and so I transferred\nto Azerbaijan. Later I met someone and married him, and now my name is\nArutunian, my husband's name . . .\n\nThat there would be a massacre was not discussed openly, but there were hints \nand gibes, so to speak, at the Armenian people, and they were mocking the \nRussians, too. I was constantly aware of it at work, and not just this past \nyear. I couldn't find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because \nI, I'll just say it, couldn't steal, couldn't deceive, and couldn't be \ninvolved in bribe-taking. And when I asked for decent working conditions they \ntold me, \"Leave, don't keep the others from working, you aren't cut out for \nthis kind of work.\" And at work and around all the time I would hear gibes at \nthe Armenians, like \"The Turks had it right, they killed them all--the way\nthey've multiplied here they're making it hard for us to live,\" and \"Things \nwill be just fine if we get rid of them all.\" \"No problem, the Turks will \nhelp,\" they say, \"if we ask them, they'll rid Armenia of Armenians in half an \nhour.\" Well that's the way it all was, but I never thought, of course that it \nwould spill over into a bloody tragedy, because you just couldn't imagine it. \nHere we've been living under the Soviet government for 70 years, and no one \neven considered such an idea possible.\n\nBut I had been forming my own opinions, and in the presence of authoritative \npeople I would often ask, \"Where is this all leading, do people really not see\nwhat kind of situation is emerging here. The Russians are fleeing Sumgait, \nthere are very few of them left. Why is no one dealing with this, what's going\non?\" And when it all happened on the 27th and 28th, it became clear that \neverything had been arranged by someone, because what else are you to make of \nit if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of the\ndemonstration with an Azerbaijani flag? I wouldn't be saying this now if I \nhadn't received personal confirmation from him later. Because when we were \nunder guard in the SK club on the 1st, he came to the club, that Muslimzade. \nThe women told me, \"There he is, there he is, that's Muslimzade.\" I didn't \nbelieve the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag. I thought that \nthey were just false rumors. I went over to him and said, \"Are you the First \nSecretary of our City Party Committee?\" He answers me, \"Yes.\" And I ask him, \n\"Tell me, did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani \nflag, and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs, I don't know \nexactly what they said, but there was mention of Armenian blood?\" And he tells\nme, \"Yes, I was there, but I tried to dissuade them from it.\" Then I asked him\nanother question: \"And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering \nus? And he said, \"I. . . We didn't know what to do, we didn't know, we didn't \nanticipate that that would happen in Sumgait.\"\n\nComrade Mamedov, the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the \nAzerbaijani SSR, answered the same question for me: \"No, we actually didn't \nanticipate the slaughter in Sumgait. At that time we were trying to contain \nthe crowd of 45,000 in Baku that was preparing for a massacre.\" Those are his \nexact words, the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of the\nArmenian SSR.\n\nAnd now, about the events themselves. Of course it's painful to discuss them, \nbecause it may seem that it's not true to someone else. Various rumors \nconcerning what happened are making the rounds: some are true, others aren't. \nBut unfortunately there are more true ones than false, because it was so \nhorrible: in our age, here in the space age, the age of science, the age of\nprogress, I don't know, if someone had told me this story, if I were living in\nor around Moscow, I wouldn't have believed it. Why not? Because it was really \na genocide, it was a massacre. That's genuinely what it was.\n\nFor example, on that day, the 28th--I didn't know about the 27th because my \nhusband and I were both sick, both of us had the flu, and we were in bed--on \nthe 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says, \"You're in bed? You don't \nknow anything about it? There was a demonstration in town, and after it they \nwere overturning Armenian cars and burning them. They were looking into cars \nand asking, 'Are you an Armenian?' If they answered in Armenian, then they \nturned the car over and burned it.\" This isn't made up, the wife of the Senior\nInvestigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us. He was \nreturning home from his dacha with his wife, Raisa Sevastyanova, she's my \nneighbor. She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the \nmiddle of it, I don't know what to call it, the cavalcade of automobiles they \nwere stopping. He answered in Azerbaijani, they let them go, but they made him\nhonk the horn, they were kicking up a fracas. We didn't even believe it, and \nI said, \"Certainly that didn't happen, how can that be?\" And she said, \n\"Muslimzade was leading the crowd, and the Sputnik store was completely\nsmashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians. And when he saw \nthat they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, \"Don't break \nthe shop windows, don't destroy state property, but do whatever else you want.\n\" I didn't hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the store was\ntorn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians \nalthough he's an Azerbaijani.\n\nWhile we were talking, all of a sudden right across from us . . . Sevastyanova\nis the first to look out the window and say, \"Look, there's a crowd out \nthere.\" And sure enough, when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had \nalready started wrecking the neighboring building. There was an Armenian \nfamily there, a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I'm sorry, I \ndon't know the building number or the people's names, since we were in my \nhusband's apartment, in Microdistrict 8, and I lived in Microdistrict No. 3. \nThere was awful looting going on there at the time, the most hideous things \nwere going on there then. One building there, ours, was attacked twice, once \nwasn't enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn't finished\nthe Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they \nbeat the Azerbaijanis too. They also beat Russians, if it was Russians doing \nthe hiding. Because there were Russians among them, they said so on \ntelevision, there were people of various nationalities. But they didn't tell \nus why there were people of different nationalities. Because they wouldn't \nhave touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn't dared to stick up for the \nArmenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes.\n\nAt the time I saw this from the window I was there, Sevastyanova was there, \nand so was my husband. We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly \noff a balcony. All kinds of things, even a sofa. Then, when it was all down \nthere, they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. At \nfirst I couldn't figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband, \n\"Lendrush, l think they're beating someone out there.\" And he answered, \"I \ndon't know, could be.\" Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and I saw \nit, and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way, \nhe didn't see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging \nher. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell \ndown, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their \nbalconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of \nblocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that's a good block and a half or two \nfrom here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself.\n\nThen the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you can\nof course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? And\nI also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented\nthat woman, because I had just seen that.\n\nI asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, \"You kill me first, and then \nlet them do what they want with the corpse.\" But our neighbors, it's true, \ndefended us, they said, \"There aren't any Armenians in our entryway, go away, \nonly Muslims live here.\" Disaster missed us that time.\n\nBut at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately, \ncame back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he's \nupset about something, but I can't. I was standing, running from balcony to \nbalcony. Our power was out, I don't remember for how long, but it was as \nthough it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever, \nand I was glad, of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look \nand the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first \ntime they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the \nmorning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the \nAzerbaijani, was awake and watching out, there were human beings among them \ntoo. So she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be taking\ngarbage out at two o'clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went \ntoward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you \ncould see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke \nAzerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, \"What do you want?\" And \nthey answered, \"We want the Armenian family that lives here\" [pointing toward \nthe second floor with their hands]. She says, \"I already told you, we don't \nhave any Armenians here, now leave, do you hear, this is an old Muslim woman \ntalking to you,\" and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around\nher and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away. And so they \nseemed to listen to her. They were all very young, they started apologizing \nand left. That was the second time death was at our door.\n\nI forgot to mention about one other apartment, a man named Rubik lives there, \nI don't know him really, I knew his daughter, I mean I saw her around, but we \nreally didn't know them. But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth \nfloor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight \nmonths, to earn money. Can you imagine what that means? He risked his life to \nearn X amount of money in order to better his family. He bought new furniture \nand was getting ready to give his daughter's hand in marriage, but, alas,\neverything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels. They threw everything \nout the windows, and the rest we saw from our balcony: how the neighbors on \nthe left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that \nhadn't already been smashed or taken. What is one to think of that? It means \nthat the parents in those families were in on it too. Unfortunately I came to \nbe of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been \nforeseen in advance: both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of \napartments. Something on the order of \"We'll move the Armenians out and take \nover their apartments.\"\n\nI have worked honestly my whole life, you can check everything about me. I \ncame as a patriot from China, waited for nights on end in front of the \nConsulate General of the USSR, I came to my homeland as a patriot because I \nknew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things. But when I saw in \nSumgait that there wasn't anything holy about them, that Party membership was \nbought, that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that there were \nno ideals, no ideas, God save me, everything was being bought and sold, I saw \nall of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did.\n\nI can't talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . When I\nwent out of my own apartment--they picked us up under Soviet Army guard, they \nhad arrived from all over to suppress that gang--not only Armenians, but some \nRussian families and their children, too, came out of their apartments and\njoined us, because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with \nthe situation the way it was. And what's interesting is that when we left on \nthe buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people, for sure \npeople would basically rise to the situation, would have some compassion for \nthe Armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. But \nhaving analyzed and weighed the whole thing, once I calmed down, having \nthought it all through, I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people. \nIf a lot of Azerbaijanis didn't want their Armenian neighbors to be killed, \nand that basically depended on that Muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to \ncalm them down--then is it possible that he didn't have people at hand to whom\nhe could whisper at the last minute, \"Go and announce it on television: \nCitizens of Sumgait! Take what you can into your hands, let's protect our \nneighbors from this massacre?\" Those crowds weren't such that there was no \ncontrolling them. Basically they were unarmed. They didn't have firearms, \nmostly they had knives, they had all kinds of metal parts, like armature \nshafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, different to a degree that we \nnoticed them: there aren't rocks like those in Sumgait soils, they were \nbrought from somewhere, as though it were all specially planned. So as I was \nsaying, I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend \nus, why wasn't it arranged? It means that the government didn't want to do \nit. When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik, \nwhat, there was no way of informing Baku? No, there was no way, it turns out!\nThe crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict. I won't mention the things \nI didn't see myself, I'll only talk about the things I myself witnessed. They \nwere in Microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o'clock in the evening, when I saw them\nfrom the other building, and they were somewhere else until mid-night or one \no'clock in the morning, because at 2:15 they came back to our building. They\nhadn't completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict 8. \nWhen they returned to our building I told my husband, \"Lendrush, now the \npolice are probably going to come, my God, now the authorities are probably \ngoing to find out and come to our aid.\" Well, alas, no, there were to be no \nauthorities, not a single policeman, not a single fireman, not a single \nambulance came while they were raging, as it turns out, as we later found out,\nbeginning on the Might of the 27th. There were dead people, ruined apartments,\nand burned autos: one car near the bus station, it was burned and overturned, \nit was probably there about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in \nBlock 45! Those who live there know, they saw from their balconies how they \nattacked the soldiers in the buses, how they beat those poor, unarmed\nsoldiers, and how on that square, I can't remember the name of it, where there\nis that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now I'm upset and\nI can't think of the name . . . there's a tall building there, a 9-story, and \nfrom the balconies there people saw that butchery, when the poor soldiers, \nwearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against \nthat mob. And when they fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using \nstones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on their heads. Who could have \nguessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under \nthe Soviet government? The upshot is that this republic has not been under \nSoviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get \ninvolved.\n\nIf you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell the\ntruth, I've been struggling for truth for five years there already, the five \nyears that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad. Some people there considered \nme a demagogue, others who knows what; some think I'm an adventure seeker, and\nsome, a prankster. But I wanted everything to be right, I would become\noutraged: how can this be, why is it people treat one another this way on a \nSoviet railroad, as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property,\nor the property of some magnate, or some \"mafia\": If I want to, I'll get you \nout of here; If I want to, I'll get rid of you; If I want to, I'll do \nsomething else? And there's a black market price for everything, in the most \nbrazen way: a coach to Moscow costs so much, a coach on a local train costs so\nmuch. Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor's pool, he had \nthe nerve to tell me, maybe you won't even believe this, but this, I'm afraid,\nI heard with my own ears: \"Tatyana, just how long can you fight for something\nthat you know will never have any effect? You're alone against everyone, so \ninstead why don't you give more money to the chief conductor, and everything \nwill go fine for you.\" I started to cry, turned, and left. What else could I \ndo, where else could I go to complain? I realized that everything was useless.\nAnd the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see\nit. I filed a written complaint, and they ground it into dust, they destroyed \nit, I still have a copy, but what's the use? When the General Procuracy got \ninvolved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair, in addition to \nthe information about what I saw, what I was a witness to, I gave testimony \nabout the mafia at the railroad. They accepted my petition, but I don't know \nif they're going to pursue it or not. Because, you'll excuse me, I no longer \nbelieve in the things I aspired to, the things I believed in before: It's all \ndead. They just spit on my soul, stomped on everything, physically, and most \nimportant, spiritually, because you can lose belongings, that's nonsense, that\nall comes with time, but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in \nyou--your beliefs--are destroyed, it can be very difficult to restore them...\n\nI want to tell of one incident. I just don't know, at the time I was in such a\nstate that I didn't even take minor things into account. Here is an example.\nOf course, it's not a minor one. My neighbor, Raisa Sevastyanova, she has a\nson, Valery, who is in the 9th grade in a school in Microdistrict 8. A boy,\nVitaly [Danielian], I don't know his last name, goes to school with him, or\nrather, went to school with him. I was just sitting in an apartment trying to\nmake a phone call to Moscow . . . Oh yes, and there's one important detail:\nWhen the massacre began, for two to three hours the phones weren't working in \nArmenian apartments, and later, in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments.\nBut the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not call \nanywhere. Why? Again, it means it was all planned. How come service is cut off\nfor no reason? And the lights went off. And those brats were raging as they\nliked They weren't afraid, they ran about freely, they that no one would slap \ntheir hands and no one would dare to stop them.  They knew it.\n\nNow I'm going to tell about the incident. So this little Vitaly, Vitalik, an\nArmenian boy, went to school with Valery; they were in the same class. \nAccording to what Valery and his neighbor pal said--at the time I was in the\nsame apartment as they were, I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put\nthrough--a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived. So Valery ran to\nhis mother and said, \"Mamma, please let me go to Vitalik's, what if they kill\nhim? Maybe he's still alive, maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow.\n. . . He's a nice guy, we all like him, he's a good person, he's smart.\" His \nmother wouldn't let him go. In tears, she says, \"Valery, you can't go because \nI am afraid.\" He says, \"Mamma, we can get around the crowd. We'll just watch, \njust have a look.\" They made it through. I don't know, I think Vitalik's\nparents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a \nsuperficial deduction. Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken \neverywhere, that you could see from the street which were the Armenian \napartments in the building, they went here and there and looked, and saw that \nthe windows were intact, and so they calmed down. But even though the windows \nin that apartment were not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and \nVitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already \nbeen murdered. Little Vitalik didn't even know they were dead. So two weeks \nago, I don't know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we \nleft Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to \nYerevan. So it's been about a month already; it's so hard to keep all this \nstraight. So Valery, the next day, when he found out that Vitalik's family has\nbeen killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku, Valery and\nhis classmates got together and went to visit him. But they wouldn't admit \nthem, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in \na coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being \nkicked and dragged was in that hospital too. As it turns out she was brought \nthere in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . .\n\nWhen we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another, \nthrow ourselves into their arms and kiss them, because you had wondered if \nthese friends were alive or not, if those friends were alive or not  . . . And\nwhen you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived! When\nyou saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end.\n\nIf you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. A book of \nthings it is even difficult to believe. And those two girls who were raped \nwere entirely black and blue, the ones at the SK, they know I'm not lying, \nthat girlfriend came up to one of them and said, \"What happened?\" and she \nbared her breasts, and they were completely covered in cigarette burns . . . \nthose rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts. After something like that \nI don't know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it.\n\nNow . . . When we stayed at the military unit for a while, they provided,\nwell, basic conditions for us there. The military unit is located in Nasosny,\nsome six miles from Sumgait. And living there we met with a larger group\nof people. There were about 1,600 people at the unit. You know, there was a\npoint when I couldn't even go outside because if you went outside you saw\nso much heartbreak around you. And when you hear the false rumors . . .\n\nYes, by the way, false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians\naround Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground\nwith bulldozers. I didn't know whether to believe it or not. And people who \ndon't know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. But when \nI arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak, and in Spitak all those villages are \nnot only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they \nwere guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak. Not a \nsingle person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. Around Yerevan \nall the villages are safe and unharmed, and the Armenians didn't attack \nanyone. But actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there\ncould have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don't\nknow why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are \nguilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread in\nAzerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not\nonly perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it \nseems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; \"Did \nyou know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31 \npeople, but later they found a 32nd), 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an \nArmenian?\"\n\nOf course I'm upset, but it's utterly impossible to discuss such things and\nnot become upset. Sometimes l forget things, but I know I want to return to\nthe time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee.\nWhen I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I \ncouldn't believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. I already\nmentioned this, and if I repeat anything, please excuse me. I asked him, \"Why \ndid you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? To laugh at \nthese women who are strewn about on the floor?\" The overcrowding there was \ntremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children were\nalready sick. It's true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They \ncooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but \nthe thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at \nit everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they \nwere never given any direct orders, they didn't know what they were authorized\nto do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o'clock in the evening\nthat Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait, \nwas given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored \npersonnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart \nadvised him, and relocate people to the military unit.\n\nBut that's not what I want to talk about now. Muslimzade, characteristically, \ntried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party\nCommittee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by the\nhand and said, \"Citizen, don't worry, we'll go and have a talk in my office.\nI told him, \"No, after everything you've done, I don't believe one iota of \nwhat you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I'll disappear, and the \ntraces of me will disappear too. Because you can't stand it when . . . \" Oh \nyes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even \nvery funny, although at the time I wasn't up to laughing. He was in a nice, \nexpensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, \"Oh, why \ndid you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume,\nyou're in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You came\nto ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who are\nalready getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh at\nthem?\" And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don't know who \nhe was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade's head \nand hid it. Then I said, \"My God! We're not marauders. We're not you! We \ndidn't come to you with the intention of stealing!\" \"Well kill me, kill me!\" \nMuslimzade says to me, \"But I'm not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I'm not\nguilty.\" And I say, \"OK, fine, you're not guilty, have it your way. But give \nus an answer, we're asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and \nraping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things, \ncarrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you \nthen?\" \"You know, we didn't expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn't \nanticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait.\" I started \nlaughing and said, \"It's truly funny.\" He says, \"What could I do? We didn't \nknow what to do.\" And I say, \"I'm sorry, but it'll be ridiculous if I tell \nyou: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn't march out in \nfront with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross \nover his dead body. That's what you should have done. That's the way it was \nduring the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself;\neither he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran \naway, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid, \nexcuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you, \nyou tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done? \nThat's right,\" I told him, \"the City party committee got confused, all the \nparty committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused, \nthey all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with \nimpunity. And if it weren't for the troops it wouldn't have been just two \ndays, there wouldn't be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would \nhave finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some \nRussians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told \nthem, 'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we'll come after you, too.\"\n\nAnd by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. He was\nthe one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later\narrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us to\nthe military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We \nasked him, \"What? How? What will come of us?\" He openly said, \"You know, for \nus the main thing now is to catch that gang. We'll finish that quickly. You'll\nstay at the military unit for the time being, and we'll decide later.\" The \nGeneral Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all \ncities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because \nthe affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke;\nas everyone knows, he's the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When \nhe gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit, \nby the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn't not say it, \nbecause he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen, \nand he said, \"There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it's\nhorrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely \npunished, in accordance with our laws.\" And that's a quote. Then one mother \nthrows herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says,\n\"Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?\" They tried \nto calm her down, and he said, \"In order for us to conduct a proper \ninvestigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you \nmust help us, because we don't know, maybe there was someone else in the gang \nwho is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe \nsomeone saw something. Don't be afraid, write about it in detail. So that \nyou're not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having \nlived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth \nabout, let's say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge \nlater. We're going to do it like this: We're going to set up an urn and you \ncan throw what you write in there. We don't need to know who wrote it. The \nnames of the people who write won't be made public, but we need all the\ninformation. Let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is \nnecessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening \ngibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put \nthe information into the urn.\"\n\nTwo soldiers and a major guarded the urn. And, sure enough, many people, \npeople who didn't even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me, she \ncame up and said, \"You, as a Russian, the same thing won't happen to you as \nwill happen to me. So please . . . I'll give you the information, and you \nplease write it down for me.\" So she was afraid, and there were a lot like\nher . . . But later, after Katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote down\neverything she knew. And we threw it all into the urn. Now we don't know if \nit will be of any use. For a factual picture will emerge from all that \ninformation. One person can lie, but thousands can't lie, thousands simply \ncan't lie. You have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. Why, for example, \nshould someone say that black is white if it is really black?\n\n   The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani\nSSR, Mamedov, as I said, was in Yerevan. My husband and I were at the Council \nof Ministers of the Armenian SSR and found out that Mamedov was present, the \none who had come to convince the people of Sumgait to  return to their \nprevious dwellings, to their old apartments. We asked for a meeting with him, \nand it was granted. When we went to see him he tried to behave properly, very \npolitely, delicately, but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and \nwhen I asked him some of the same questions I had asked Muslimzade, \"Where were\nyou personally when they were beating us? Now you're trying to convince us to \nreturn, why didn't you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where \nit was all leading?\" he says, \"You're telling the truth. Let's not mince \nwords. You've told me right to my face, and I'll tell you straight. I'll tell \nyou the pure truth. I was gotten out of bed in the evening, the whole \ngovernment was up, including me, and we were restraining a crowd of about \n45,000 in Baku. But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait, with its \nfine international record, such a thing could happen. We expected it in Baku.\"\nI say, \"So that means you expected it all the same? Why were you expecting \nit?\" And he says, \"You know, it just happened that way. We were expecting it \nin Baku, we were trying to restrain it, but in Sumgait . . . \" I say, \"Fine, \nyou didn't know for the first three or four hours, but then you should have \nknown. Why did no one help us?\" And he says, \"Well, OK, we didn't know what to\ndo\" and things like that. Basically it was the same story I got from \nMuslimzade. Later, when he said, \"You go on back, the situation in Sumgait is \nfavorable now, everything is fine, the Armenians are friendly with the \nAzerbaijanis . . . \" To this l answered, \"You know what . . . I'm speaking \nwith you as a [member of a] neutral nation . . . I have never argued with \nArmenians or with Azerbaijanis and I was an eyewitness . . . You tell me, \nplease, Comrade Mamedov, \" I asked him, \"What would you say about this\nhonestly, if you were being completely frank with us?\" Then he said, \"Yes, I \nadmit that I am honestly ashamed, shame on the entire Azerbaijani nation, we \nhave disgraced ourselves not only before the entire Soviet Union, but before \nthe whole world. Because now the Voice of America and all the other foreign \nradio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors, too.\"\nAnd I say, \"There's nothing to add to what really happened. I don't think it's\npossible to add anything more awful.\" He says, \"Yes, I agree with you, I \nunderstand your pain, it is truly an unfortunate occurrence.\" I repeat that he\nsaid \"unfortunate occurrence.\" And then he suddenly remembered himself, what \nhe was saying--he had a pen in his hands, he was fidgeting with it nervously--\nand said, \"Oh, excuse me, a tragedy, really . . . \" I take this to mean that \nhe really thinks it's an \"unfortunate occurrence.\" \"And of course,\" he says, \n\"I understand that having gone through all this you can't return to Sumgait, \nbut it's necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being \ntried.\" And he even gave a detail, which, I don't know if it matters or not, \nthat 160 policemen were being tried. Specifically in relation to that bloody \naffair.\n\nYes, by the way, there is another good detail, how I was set up at work in\nBaku after the events. I went to an undergarment plant, there was an \nAzerbaijani working there, and suddenly she tells me, \"What, they didn't\nnail your husband? They screwed up.\" I was floored, I hadn't imagined that\nanyone in Baku, too, could say something like that. Well after that I went up\nto see . . . to my office, I needed to find out about those days, what was\ngoing to happen with them, how they were going to put down those days from \nFebruary 29 to March 10 . . . and the administrator told me, \"I don't know, \nTatyana, go to the head of the conductors' pool. Be grateful if they don't \nput it down as unexcused absence.\" I was really discouraged by this. They all \nknow that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived, and here \nthey're telling me that I was skipping work, as though I was off enjoying \nmyself somewhere. I went to the office of the chief of the pool, his last name\nis Rasulov, and he's had that position for many years. Incidentally, he's a \nParty member, and is a big man in town. And suddenly, when I went to him and \nsaid, \"Comrade Rasulov, this is the way it was . . . \" He looked at me askance\nand said, \"And why are you\"--he knows me by my previous last name--\"why did\nyou get wrapped up in this mess?\" I say, \"What do you mean, why did I get \nwrapped up in this mess? My husband's an Armenian,\" I tell him, \"I have an \nArmenian last name.\" And he screwed up his face, made a kind of a grimace, as \nthough he had eaten something sour, and said, \"I didn't expect that you would\n. . . \" What did he mean by that? And \"how\" should he behave, the chief of the\npool, a man who supervises 1,700 workers? Now, it's true, there was a \nreduction, but for sure there are still 1,200 conductors working for him. And \nif someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that, then what \ncan you expect from a simple, uneducated, politically unsophisticated person?!\nHe's going to believe any and all rumors, that the Armenians are like this, \nthe Armenians are like that, and so on . . .\n\nBy the way, that Mamedov--now I'm going back to Mamedov's office when I asked \nhim \"Are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return \nto Sumgait?\" he answered, \"Yes, you know, I would guarantee them . . . I don't\nwant to take on too much, I would guarantee them firmly for 50 years. But I \nwon't guarantee them for longer than 50 years.\" I say, \"So you've got another\nthing like that planned for 50 years from  now? So they'll be quiet and then \nin another 50 years it'll happen again?!\" I couldn't contain myself any more,\nand I also told him, \"And how did it get to that point, certainly you knew\nabout it, how they were treating the Russians, for example, in Baku and in \nSumgait, how they were hounded from their jobs? Certainly you received\ncomplaints, I wrote some myself. Why did no one respond to them? Why did \neveryone ignore what was going on? Didn't you prepare people for this by the \nway you treated them?\" And he says, \"You know, you're finally starting to \ninsult me!\" He threw his pen on the desk. \"Maybe now you'll say I'm a \nscoundrel too?\" I say, \"You know, I'm not talking about you because I don't \nknow. But about the ones who I do know I can say with conviction, yes, that \ncomrade was involved in this, that, and that, because I know for certain.\n\"Well anyway he assured us that here, in Yerevan, there were false rumors, \nthat 3,000 Sumgait Armenians were here, and 15,000 were in Sumgait and had \ngotten back to work. Everyone was working, he said, and life was very good. \n\"We drove about the town ourselves, Comrade Arutiunian [First Secretary of \nthe Communist Party of Armenia SSR] came from the Council of Ministers of \nArmenian, he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in\nSumgait.\" When I asked Mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said, '\n\"Well, I walked down the street.\" And I said, \"Walking down the street in any \ncity, even if I were to go to New York, I would never understand the situation\nbecause I would be a guest, I don't have any contact with people, but if you \nspend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that they didn't \nknow you were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, you'd \nhear something quite different.\" I told him, for example, that I drew my \nconclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments. They took\nus all in turns to pick things up, since people had fled to the military unit;\nthey got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible. How are the \nneighbors in the microdistrict, how will they view us, what do they think? I \nthought maybe that in fact it wasn't something general, of a mass nature, some\nanti-national something. And when that bus took us to our building, because it\nwas the same bus, while we were going up to our apartment, an armed soldier \naccompanied us. What does that say? It speaks of the fact that if everything \nthere were fine, why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with\nus, going from apartment to apartment? And in fact, especially with the young \npeople, you could sense the delight at our misfortune, the grins, and they \nwere making comments, too. And that was in the presence of troops, when police\ndetachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and \ntanks were passing by. And if people are taking such malicious delight when \nthe situation is like that, then what is it going to be like when they \nwithdraw protection from the city altogether? There will be more outrages, of \ncourse, perhaps not organized, but in the alleys . . .\n\n  April 20, 1988\n  Yerevan\n\n\t\t     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

{"text": "I wrote :\n  Nice strawman indeed.  The discussion is not about whether there were\ntanks\n  used in sixties riots; instead, it is about whether those tanks fired\ntheir\n  main guns in one of those riots.  You claim they did.  That claim is\n  ludicrous.\n\nAwesley replied:\n     I repeated what I had been told, under what context I had heard it,\n  supporting the claim that tanks were indeed used in Detroit in 67.\n\nThe issue has never been whether tanks were used in Detroit in 1967.  It\nhas been whether they fired their main guns.  You did not merely claim that\ntanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress\nsniper fire and that they were \"quite\" effective at this.  You continue to\nback away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is\ndisputing.\n\nAwesley went on:\n  I\n  spent a few minutes in a library today -- found their computer was\n  down and they don't have a card catalog.  Anyway, it took about 10\n  minutes to find this in _Nightmare in Detroit, A Rebellion and It's\n  Victims_ by Sauter and Hines, on page 133, telling of the death of\n  Tonia Blanding, age 4.\n   \n        \"When the tank was fired upon by snipers it turned in the direction\n  the shots came from. [...] the fifty-caliber machine gun mounted on the\n  tank belched fire into the buildings.  After a short round into the front\n  of the buildings, the tank guns spit again, tearing apart huge holes out\n  of the side of the apartment.\"\n  \n       Well, it's not the main gun.  \n\n\"Well, it's not the main gun.\"  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you\nnow going to admit that you were wrong?\n\n  will I see any pictures of tanks firing their main\n  guns?  Will I see pictures of buildings damaged by the shells?  Will I\nread\n  the reports of the tank fire?  I'll bet you dollar to doughnuts I won't. \n  It will take more than second-hand accounts from a few old National Guard\n  sergeants shooting the shit to convince me that tanks shelled American\n  cities in the Sixties.\n\nAwesley replied:\n    Well, if you bothered to read them, it wouldn't take long at all to\n  find reports of tank * fire * -- although not necessarily of the main\n  guns.\n\nI will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67\nriots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place\nwithout it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American\nmilitary firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have\nbeen *big* news.\n\nAwesley goes on:\n  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.\n\nTo fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion\ngrenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be\nperfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since\nit makes your other claim seem more plausible.\n\nAnd on:\n  I don't\n  expect to convince you; you'll have to open your mind and eyes and\nactually\n  do a little research to be convinced one way or the other.

(What Microsoft means by \"Device Independent\" is unclear to\n    me.) Four pixel resolutions are supported: 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit, and 24 bit\n    pixels.\n\n    These images were intended for use on DOS (IBM, or Little-Endian) systems.\n    If\tyou  are  creating them on another architecture you will have to byte-\n    swap all short and long integer values.\n\n    By convention, DIB images end in the extension \".BMP\".   This  is  because\n\n\n\n\t\t\t      March 15, 1991\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t    - 2 -\n\n\n    they  are  a  super-set of earlier \"bitmap image files\".  Consequently you\n    will sometimes hear DIB files referred to as \"BMP\" files.\n\n    Since DIB images files are a super-set, there are three \"flavors\"  of  DIB\n    images:\n\t o   DOS DIB images.  These are the recommended\t convention,  and  the\n\t     form  which I will describe how to create.\t They are intended for\n\t     applications running under MS Windows /3.0 in a DOS environment.\n\t o   OS/2 DIB images.  My understanding is that these are  the\tflavor\n\t     of DIB images that were used by the Presentation Manager.\n\t o   Old-style Bitmap images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t      March 15, 1991\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t    - 3 -\n\n\n    DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FLAVORS\n\n    The DOS DIB images consist of:\n\t 1.  A \"BITMAPFILEHEADER\" file header which identifies the file\t as  a\n\t     DIB  file.\t  This\theader\talso gives the total size of the image\n\t     file, and the offset to the image data.\n\t 2.  A \"BITMAPINFOHEADER\"  image  header  which\t specifies  the\t image\n\t     attributes.\n\t 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  If  it  exists,\n\t     this  may contain 2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a Windows\n\t     RGBQUAD structure.\n\t 4.  The image data itself.\n\n\n    The OS/2 DIB images consist of:\n\t 1.  The same \"BITMAPFILEHEADER\" file header which identifies the file\n\t     as\t a  DIB\t file.\t This  header also gives the total size of the\n\t     image file, and the offset to the image data.\n\t 2.  A \"BITMAPCOREHEADER\"  image  header  which\t specifies  the\t image\n\t     attributes.\n\t 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  Again, if  this\n\t     exists  it\t may  contain  2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a\n\t     Windows RGBTRIPLE structure.\n\t 4.  The image data itself.\n\n\n    The Old Style image bitmap consists of:\n\t 1.  Either a BITMAPINFOHEADER or a  BITMAPCOREHEADER.\t Which\theader\n\t     type is determined by the first long integer (DWORD) value.\n\t 2.  An optional color palette.\t  This\tpalette\t may  be  composed  of\n\t     either   Windows\tRGBQUAD\t  structures  (if  the\theader\twas  a\n\t     BITMAPINFOHEADER) or Windows RGBTRIPLE structures (if the\theader\n\t     was a BITMAPCOREHEADER).\n\t 3.  The image data itself.\n\n\n    CREATING DIB IMAGE FILES.\n\n    Creating a DOS DIB image file consists of several straight forward\tsteps.\n    The headers need to be created and then written to the file.  These header\n    structures are defined in the MS  Windows/3.0  \"windows.h\"\tinclude\t file.\n    Palette  information  needs\t to  be\t stored for images that are not 24-bit\n    images.  The five general steps are:\n\t 1.  Filling  in  the  BITMAPFILEHEADER\t  and\tthe   BITMAPINFOHEADER\n\t     structures the basic image information.\n\t 2.  If the image is a 1-bit, 4-bit, or an 8-bit image,\t creating  the\n\t     color palette of RGBQUADS.\n\t 3.  Calculating the total file size and putting this  information  in\n\n\n\n\t\t\t      March 15, 1991\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t    - 4 -\n\n\n\t     the \"bfSize\" field of the BITMAPFILEHEADER.\n\t 4.  Calculating the offset to the image data from the\tstart  of  the\n\t     file,   and   putting  this  in  the  \"bfOffBits\"\tfield  of  the\n\t     BITMAPFILEHEADER.\n\t 5.  Writing to the file the BITMAPFILEHEADER,\tthe  BITMAPINFOHEADER,\n\t     the color palette, and the image data (in that order).\n\n    The following sections describe structures in terms of MicroSoft  C\t type-\n    defined  keywords.\tThe following table describes these keywords for those\n    not familiar with MicroSoft C.\n\n\t\t     _______________________________________\n\t\t    |\t\t\t\t\t   |\n\t\t    | Type-defined keywords in MicroSoft C.|\n\t\t    |______________________________________|\n\t\t    | typedef |\t meaning\t\t   |\n\t\t    |_________|____________________________|\n\t\t    | BYTE    |\t unsigned character\t   |\n\t\t    | WORD    |\t two byte unsigned integer |\n\t\t    | DWORD   |\t four byte unsigned integer|\n\t\t    |_________|____________________________|\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t      March 15, 1991\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t    - 5 -\n\n\n    THE BITMAPFILEHEADER\n\n    This structure is defined in \"windows.h\" as:\n\t typedef struct tagBITMAPFILEHEADER {\n\t\t WORD\t bfType;\n\t\t DWORD\t bfSize;\n\t\t WORD\t bfReserved1;\n\t\t WORD\t bfReserved2;\n\t\t DWORD\t bfOffBits;\n\t } BITMAPFILEHEADER;\n\n    The \"bfType\" field is the two ascii characters 'B' and 'M'.\t  This\tserves\n    to\tidentify  the  file  as\t a  DIB\t image file.  On an intel byte ordered\n    machine (IBM or a compatible), this constant can be formed\tin  C  as  the\n    quantity ('M' << 8 | 'B') == 0x4d42 on an intel system.\n\n    The \"bfSize\" field is the total size of the file.  For our\tpurposes  this\n    field  is equal to: the size of the BITMAPFILEHEADER, plus the size of the\n    BITMAPINFOHEADER, plus the number of entries in the\t color\tpalette\t times\n    the\t size  of  a  RGBQUAD, plus the number of bytes of image data.\tIf the\n    image data is being written out in an uncompressed form, this value can be\n    calculated\tahead  of  time.   Otherwise, this field needs to be filled in\n    later.\n\n    Both the \"bfReserved1\" and the \"bfReserved2\"  fields  are  always  set  to\n    zero.\n\n    The \"bfOffBits\" field is set to the offset to the start of the image  data\n    from  the  start  of the file.  For our purposes, this field should be set\n    to:\t the  size  of\tthe   BITMAPFILEHEADER,\t  plus\t the   size   of   the\n    BITMAPINFOHEADER,  plus  the  number of entries in the color palette times\n    the size of a RGBQUAD.  This works out because the image data  is  written\n    write after the color palette if one exists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t      March 15, 1991\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t    - 6 -\n\n\n    THE BITMAPINFOHEADER\n\n    This structure is defined in \"windows.h\" as:\n\t typedef struct tagBITMAPINFOHEADER{\n\t\t DWORD\t biSize;\n\t\t DWORD\t biWidth;\n\t\t DWORD\t biHeight;\n\t\t WORD\t biPlanes;\n\t\t WORD\t biBitCount;\n\t\t DWORD\t biCompression;\n\t\t DWORD\t biSizeImage;\n\t\t DWORD\t biXPelsPerMeter;\n\t\t DWORD\t biYPelsPerMeter;\n\t\t DWORD\t biClrUsed;\n\t\t DWORD\t biClrImportant;\n\t } BITMAPINFOHEADER;\n\n    The \"biSize\" field is set to the size of  the  BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure\n    itself.   When  reading  the  image\t file,\tthis  value is what is used to\n    determine  that  the  image\t contains  a  BITMAPINFOHEADER\t and   not   a\n    BITMAPCOREHEADER.\n\n    The \"biWidth\" field is the width of the image in image pixels.\n\n    The \"biHeight\" field is the height of the image in image lines.\n\n    The \"biPlanes\" field should always be set to 1.  This data is written  out\n    as if there was one color plane.\n\n    The \"biBitCount\" field is the bit-depth of the image.  This must be either\n    1, 4, 8, or 24, depending on the bit-depth of the image data.\n\n    The \"biCompression\" field tells how the image data is compressed if it  is\n    compressed.\t   DIB\timages\tsupport\t two  forms  of\t run-length  encoding.\n    However, I have never seen any images which use it, and don't know yet how\n    it works.  Set this field to zero (long zero, or 0L), to indicate that the\n    data is not compressed.\n\n    All subsequent fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure  may  be  set  to\n    zero.   A  requirement  of\tthe  interpretting software that it be able to\n    compute these fields as necessary from the previous information.\n\n    The field which you might want to explicitly specify might be \"biClrUsed\".\n    For\t 4-bit\tand  8-bit  images  this  field\t indicates that not all of the\n    possible color entries are used and that the  image\t contains  \"biClrUsed\"\n    colors.  If you are using only 32 colors with an 8-bit image, then you may\n    only want to save 32 of the possible 256 palette entries.  Generally,  set\n    this field to zero.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t      March 15, 1991\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t    - 7 -\n\n\n    COLOR PALETTES\n\n    Each entry of a  color  palette  is\t a  RGBQUAD  structure.\t  The  RGBQUAD\n    structure is defined in the \"windows.h\" include file as:\n\t typedef struct tagRGBQUAD {\n\t\t BYTE\t rgbBlue;\n\t\t BYTE\t rgbGreen;\n\t\t BYTE\t rgbRed;\n\t\t BYTE\t rgbReserved;\n\t } RGBQUAD;\n    The \"rgbReserved\" field is always zero.  For each color used,  the\tamount\n    of Blue, Green, and Red are filled into the structure and the structure is\n    written to the file.  A value of zero in  the  \"rgbBlue\",  \"rgbGreen\",  or\n    \"rgbRed\"   fields  indicates  that\tthat  particular  component  does  not\n    contribute to the color composition.  A value  of  255  in\tany  of\t these\n    fields  indicates  that  the  component  contributes  fully\t to  the color\n    composition.\n\n\n\n    IMAGE DATA\n\n    There are three surprises about the ordering of image data\tin  DIB\t image\n    file.   The\t creator  of  this  format  was determined to be creative, and\n    certainly was.\n\n    Within the image data, each line written out is padded to  the  next  four\n    byte  quantity.   So,  if  you had an 8-bit image which was only one pixel\n    wide, you still have to write out four bytes for every  image  line.   The\n    number of bytes per line can be calculated as:\n\n\t\t bytes_per_line = (width_in_pix * bit_depth + 31 ) / 32 * 4;\n\n\t---or, in terms of the fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure---\n\n\t\t bytes_per_line = (biWidth * biBitCount + 31 ) / 32 * 4;\n\n\n    When writing out your image data, you must write it out bottom line first.\n    The\t bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the\n    first line of image data in the file.\n\n    For 1-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit images, information is written\tas  you\t would\n    expect.   One  bit\timages\tare  padded  eight pixels to a byte.  Four bit\n    images are padded two pixels to a byte.  Eight bit images are written  one\n    pixel per byte.  Twenty-four bit images are written three bytes per pixel.\n    However, for 24-bit images the information must  be\t written  out  in  the\n    order  blue,  green, red.  While most image file formats write data out in\n\n\n\n\t\t\t      March 15, 1991\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t    - 8 -\n\n\n    an \"RGB\" ordering, a DIB image file\t writes\t the  data  out\t in  an\t \"BGR\"\n    ordering.\n\n    SUMMARY\n\n    This  should  provide  enough  information\tto  create  DIB\t images\t  from\n    applications  such\tas  scanners  or for image exporting routines.\tIf you\n    find out any more about DIB images, please pass the information on\tto  me\n    so that I can modify this document accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t      March 15, 1991\n\n\n--\n    Thomas B.

Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would  \nlead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.   \nThree year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis  \nlast year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her  \nlifetime.  \n\nEven though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives  \nof enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory  \nPapillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide  \nsupport for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a  \nnewsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid  \nin the prevention, cure, and treatment.\n\nSince medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to  \nthose viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money  \nwere available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant  \nattention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP  \nFoundation's mission is to change that. \n\nAnyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call  \nMarlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.  Monetary donations can be made at the  \nFoundation's booth during Communiversity, April 24th, 12 to 4 p.m., in downtown  \nPrinceton, or sent directly to:", "label": 13}

The exhibition presents the untold story of the Vatican\nLibrary as the intellectual driving force behind the emergence of\nRome as a political and scholarly superpower during the\nRenaissance.  The exhibit will be on display in the Jefferson\nBuilding of the Library of Congress from January 8, 1993 through\nApril 30, 1993.

{"text": "\nTough question -- more dangerous than driving a car, and far more\ndangerous if you don't apply a modicum of intelligence to the \nactivity.  Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lot\nfaster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it is\nnot unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protective\nclothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong,\nyou are likely to be less severely injured.\n\nFirst thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course,\nthis will get you started on the right foot -- they teach\ncontrol of the vehicle and safe riding practices.\n\nSecond, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmet\nand a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy \npiece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking\nboots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine\nfor this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay \ntied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps\nare nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For the\npants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable,\npreferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for\na jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, though\nmore people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another\nthing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand\nleather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.\n\nThird don't do anything stupid -- don't ride after \ndrinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement\nand balance; don't ride in the snow, or when conditions\nare such that black ice is likely; be very careful riding\nin the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly, \nbrake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick,\ntired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, or\notherwise not in average shape.\n\nWith care, you should be ok.\n\n\nI would suggest mid to late 80's japanese mid-sized standard.\nSomething in 400-650 cc range would probably be reasonable.  If\nyou are shorter/lighter than average, you might want to go as\nlow as a 300-400 cc bike.\n\nPossible models: \nThe Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500, GS650, etc.).  These are generally\ninline 4 bikes, generally dependable except for a tendency to \nweakness in the charging system.  (Stator and/or Regulator/Rectifier \nproblems.)  My first bike was a (about '82) GS650, it server me well.\n\nThe Honda Nighthawk series (this may also be known as the CB### series\nI think).  eg. Honda CB450, CB650, etc.  This is another series of\nstandard motorcycles.  Also fairly dependable.\n\nKawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes, but I don't know\nthem as well.\n\nFor mid to late '80s models of the above, you should be able to\nbuy the bike for under $2000, leaving you money for protective \nclothing and insurance and licensing costs.", "label": 8}

{"text": "\n\nThis is misleading, at best.  The question, really, has to do with the\nstatus of the Greek Septuagint versus Hebrew scripture.  And the issue\npredates the Reformation by quite a bit -- Jerome was negative about the\n\"deuteroncanonicals\" and in fact, even though he transalted them, he put\nthem after the Hebrew canon (reordered from the Greek ordering to the\nHebrew one.)  His translations of them were quick-and-dirty, also (he\nreports having done one of them in one day, and another overnight, just\ndictating his translation to an amanuensis.\n\nThat is to say, it is the Vulgate, and all of its massive importance in\nWestern Christianity, along with the veneration of Jerome, which took the\nfirst steps in \"reducing\" these books from the status they had (and have)\namong the Greeks.\n\nFurthermore, it is inaccurate to say that the Reformers \"threw out\" these\nbooks.  Basically, they just placed them in a secondary status (as Jerome\nhad already done), but with the additional warning that doctrine should\nnot be based on citations from these ALONE.\n\nI think that the emphasis on the Hebrew originals is sound, though it\nseems somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation as\npart of a collection whose principles of selection (in Hebrew or Greek)\nare confused or unknown and likely fraught with accident.  It also seems\nto play into a tendentious notion of the original languages being somehow\n\"more inspired\" -- as if magical, and conveying a message untranslatable\n-- than a translation, as if we could not hear God's word to the Jews in\nGreek (or German, or English, ...).  This tendency seems to have got a\nbig boost in _sola scriptura_ Protestantism, even to the point of current\n\"inerrancy\" bizarreness, despite the more basic, underlying tendency of\nthe Reformers to see that the texts SHOULD and COULD be translated.  If\nwe can profit from an English rendering of Hebrew and Greek, there is\nsurely little reason to keep Sirach, at least, out of our Bibles (and of\ncourse, Anglicans don't do so :-)).  For texts originally in Greek, it\nwould seem more to be anti-Greek prejudice (notably, by the time the\nHebrew canon is fully attested, including anti-Christian prejudice which\nled to the Jewish abandonment of the Septuagint) which is operative.\n\nBTW: readers may enjoy some lectures of Bruce Metzger on the issues of\ntranslation of the Bible (including some of what I said about Jerome,\nabove) in the current numbers of the journal _Bibliotheca Sacra_; two\nof four have been published so far.", "label": 15}

It is\npossible that the story they know is not that found in the Hebrew\nBible, but rather another similar and related story. (One has the\nsame problem with direct quotes.)\n\nAgain, Matthew 1:5 (\"Boaz begat Obed of Ruth\") tells us that Matthew\nknew a story about a woman named Ruth who married a man called Boaz\nand  became the ancestor of David. Since Ruth is not mentioned in\nthe OT outside the Book of Ruth, it seems likely that Matthew was\nfamiliar with the book and respected it, and thought Ruth important\nenough to be one of the few women mentioned in the genealogy.\n\nReferences like this do not prove that the NT writer considered his\nOT source inspired or inerrant or canonical.

{"text": "Hypostasis\n\n[I've explained it here before.  If you want the full document, ask me by mail\n--Rex] \n\n\n   \"Questions arise as we begin to think about LOGOS and what His inner\nconsciousness was composed of. We need to clarify the two natures of Christ\nbriefly.  The divine nature, which has existed eternally, did not undertake any\nessential changes during the incarnation which would cause a conflict with the\nattributes of God, the foremost of these being His immutability.  This would\nmean that it remained impassable, that is, incapable of suffering and death,\nfree from ignorance and insusceptible to weakness and temptation.  In the realm\nof the divine nature it is better to say that the Son of God became that which\nwas not absolute-and in Himself.  The result of the incarnation was that the\ndivine LOGOS could be ignorant and weak, could be tempted and suffer and die,\nnot in His divine nature, but by the derivation of His possession of a human\nnature.\n     This would mean that both the properties of the divine nature and the\nhuman nature are properties of the person, and therefore ascribed to the\nperson. By this reason we can say that the person can be omnipotent,\nomniscient, and omnipresent, yet at the same time be also a man of limited\npower, knowledge, a man of sorrows, subject to human wants and miseries.  There\nis, however, no penetration of one nature into the other.  Deity can no more\nshare the imperfections of humanity than humanity can share in the essential\nperfection of the Godhead.\n     We are not to assume that there is a double personality due to the\npossession of the double natures.  Christ's human nature is impersonal, in that\nit attains self-consciousness and self-determination in the personality of the\nGod-man.  We must now differentiate between the person and the nature of the\nMan. Nature is defined:\n\n\"the distinguishing qualities or properties of something; the fundamental\ncharacter, disposition or temperament of a living being, innate and\nunchangeable.\"\n\n     Nature is then, in essence, the substance possessed in common, in as such\nthe Trinity have one nature.  There is also a common nature of mankind. \nPersonality, on the other hand, is the separate subsistence of nature, with the\npower of consciousness and will.  It is for this reason that the human nature\nof Christ has not, nor ever had, a separate subsistence, that it is impersonal.\n LOGOS, the God-man, represents the principle of personality.  It is equally\nimportant to see that self-consciousness and self-determination do not, as\nsuch, belong to the nature.  It is for this reason that we can justifiably say\nthat Jesus did not have two consciousness or two wills, but rather one.  It is\ntheanthropic, an activity of the one personality which unites in itself the\nhuman and the divine natures, being that neither the consciousness nor the will\nare simply human or simply divine.\"\n\n\n[The quotation given above is not identified, and it's not entirely\nclear to me what position Loren is taking on it.  Just for clarity,\nlet me note that the view expressed in it is one of the classic\nChristological heresies -- monothelitism.  That's the position that\nChrist's two natures were not complete, in that there was only one\nwill.  In most cases (which I think includes this example), it was the\nhuman will that was regarded as missing.\n\nNormally people who talk about Christ's human nature as being\n\"impersonal\" mean it in a somewhat more abstract sense.  That is, they\nare using \"person\" as hypostatis, not in the usual English sense of\npersonality.  In this use, the doctrine is called \"anhypostasia\".\nPersonally I think anhypostasia is just a more sophisticated way of\ndenying that the Logos took on humanity fully.  However it has never\nbeen formally ruled a heresy, and in fact has been held by influential\ntheologians both ancient and modern (e.g. Athanasius).  But the\nquotation above appears to be going farther than even Athanasius went,\ninto the realm of the overtly heretical.", "label": 15}

This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives \nwhen performing diagnostics.\n   There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way \ninterface connector. They have the following functions and are described \nin order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper \ndescribed nearest the 40 way interface connector.\n\nLK2: LED \n     When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the\n     interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An\n     external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with\n     the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will\n     be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130\n     Ohms ot 220 Ohms.\n\nLK1: Dual Drives\n     This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single\n     bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,\n     indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.\n\nLK4: Master\n     When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If\n     there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be\n     jumpered in this way.\n\nLK5: IOChRdy\n     When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is \n     fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher\n     data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per\n     second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally \n     fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per\n     second.\n\n   There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s)\nmay be jumpered:\n\n     Master, single drive with LED on interface\t\tLK2 & LK4 fitted.\n     Master, single drive without LED on interface\tLK4 only fitted.\n     Master, dual drive without LED on interface\tLK4 & LK1 fitted.\n     Slave, dual drive without LED on interface\t\tNo jumpers fitted.\n     Master, dual drive with LED on interface\t\tLK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.\n     Slave, dual drive with LED on interface\t\tLK2 only fitted.\n\n   The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to\nreduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.\n\n   The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way \nconnector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected\nby the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the \ndrive for this LED driver.

Stop and think for a moment,\nBM] will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it\nBM] is a part of it.  \n\nhenrik]   Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged \nhenrik]   training AZERIS militarily to fight against  KARABAKHI-Armenians.\n\nSo?  Should I, at this point break into caps and start talking about \nDEFENSE etc.?  I don't know how 'fully engaged' Turkey is/was though.\n\nhenrik] The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000 \nhenrik] years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the \nhenrik] ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending \nhenrik] themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION. \n\nBM] Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them\nBM]  within their borders?  \n\nhenrik] Well, history is SAD. Remember, those are relocated Azeris into \nhenrik] the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime.\n\nSo I hear.  This justifies bloodshed N years after the fact?\n\nhenrik] At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the \nhenrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER \nhenrik] OCCUR again.\n\nBM] You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?\n\nhenrik] It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped\nhenrik] into Armenia if SHE could.\n\nWhy would Turkey do that?  Do you not realize that this is a local clash\nthat Turkey never wished to see happen?  Turkey has other plans for region,\nlike economic revival, co-operation etc.  Good stuff in other words,  I'd\nbe happy to bicker with Armenians over trade barriers and such on USENET\nrather than 'who killed whom in what way' which I detest doing and wouldn't \ndo.  \n\nBM] Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header\nBM] in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?  \n\nhenrik]\t   Absolutely NOT ! I am merely trying to emphasize that in many\nhenrik]\t   cases, HISTORY repeats itself. \n\nEven if one buys into your implicit premise, the sane thing to do would\nbe to try not to provoke Turkey as was done in '74.  If there'd been\na democratic government instead of a bunch of idiots in Athens at the\ntime, everybody would have stayed home with their families.  [I have no\nwish to go into the Cyprus quarrel, but I suspect what I've said is not\nonly accurate but also palatable to all parties involved]\n\nBM] Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes \nBM] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring\nBM] the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians \nBM] are attacking Azeri towns.\n\nhenrik]\t   So, let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey\nhenrik]\t   wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !!\n\nSo what do you think we want?  War, death and destruction?  \n\nhenrik]\t   I will believe it when I see it.\n\nNo, if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it.\n\nhenrik]  Now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing\nhenrik]to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?\n\t\nThis kind of childish rhetoric doesn't help anthing.\n\nhenrik]  Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the\nhenrik]  BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean\nhenrik]  BURNING people ALIVE !\n\nNow, some Azeri will come out and give a description of similar stuff\nperpetrated by Armenians.  One should re-hash stuff like this often to\nkeep the hatred alive, right?\n\nBM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the \nBM]futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that \nBM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's \nBM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.  \n\nhenrik]\t   Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are \nhenrik]\t   NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY \nhenrik]\t   from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN. \n\nWell they obviously aren't getting anywhere with their current methods\nof asking (not very peaceful I'd say).\n\nBM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent \nBM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe \nBM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better \nBM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?\n\nhenrik]\t   Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the\nhenrik]\t   conflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in\nhenrik]\t   KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.\n\nI don't know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans.\nPeace isn't what's happening right now, furthermore what's happening\nright now isn't condusive to peace.  You can spend days and nights \nraving about how 'right' the Armenian position is and I'm sure\nthere'll be others who'd be happy to talk to you by arguing the other\nside.  If entrenched positions lead to war, and if people want peace\nthan they should sit down and talk about a compromise.  Armenia isn't\nstrong enough to exercise the 'we think we're right, and we have the \nbombs, so we'll do whatever we want, so there...' style of foreign \nrelations.  Yes you can type Stalin in caps, and give one sided\natrocity stories etc. but for peace you need to be willing to talk to \nthe other side.  You personally can choose not to do that of course,\nthis being just USENET.  The people in power shouldn't be so childish.\n\n\nBM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes\nBM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of \nBM] their blood and future. \n\nhenrik]\t   Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension\nhenrik]\t   to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH\nhenrik]\t   are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.\n\nAzeri's would disagree with you on this, and the maps I've seen support\nwhat they'd be saying.  It doesn't seem likely that a solution will be\nreached in this manner.  \n\nBM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize \nBM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians\nBM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate \nBM] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in\nBM] the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  I'd push for\nBM] compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading\nBM] inflammatory half-truths.\n\nhenrik]   It is NOT up to me to decide the PEACE initiative. I am absolutely\nhenrik]   for it. \n\nIt didn't look it when I read your posting.  It would seem to me \nthat if you can spew mis-information about a boogey-man, you can also\ntalk about how one might avoid the nastiness.  Fair?\n\nhenrik] But, in the meantime, if you do not take care of yourself,\nhenrik] you will be WIPED out. Such as the case in the era of 1915-20 of\nhenrik] The Armenian Massacres.\n\nYou don't realize I can say the same thing about 'The Turkish Massacres.'\nYes, boys and girls, let's always talk about how bad and nasty things were.\nLet's do that so we're overwhelmed by anger, and let's do that so our\nkids will also be hateful.

After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological\npatterns that you proposed, then semi-retracting that claim by stating\nthat you weren't referring to *all* atheists, I asked you to name some\natheists who you feel don't fit your patterns, to show that you indeed\nwere not referring to all atheists that you are aware of.

{"text": "I received the following two notes from Martin Hellman with details\non how Clipper will work.  They are posted with his permission.  The\nimplications of some details are fascinating.\n\n-------\nDate: Sat, 17 Apr 93 23:05:23 PDT\nFrom: \"Martin Hellman\" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu>\nTo: (a long list of recipients)\nSubject: Clipper Chip\n\n\nMost of you have seen the announcement in Friday's NY Times,\netc. about NIST (National Institute of Standards & Technology)\nannouncing the \"Clipper Chip\" crypto device. Several messges\non the net have asked for more technical details, and some have\nbeen laboring under understandable misunderstandings given\nthe lack of details in the news  articles. So here to help out\nis your friendly NSA link: me. I was somewhat surprised Friday\nto get a call from the Agency which supplied many of the missing\ndetails. I was told the info was public, so here it is (the cc of this\nto Dennis Branstad at NIST is mostly as a double check on my\nfacts since I assume he is aware of all this; please let me know\nif I have anything wrong):\n\nThe Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in \nSilicon. Each chip will have two secret, 80-bit keys. One will be the \nsame for all chips (ie a system-wide key) and the other will be unit \nspecific. I don't know what NIST and NSA will call them, but I will \ncall them the system key SK and unit key UK in this message. \nThe IC will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so \nthat the system key can be kept secret. (Aside: It is clear that \nthey also want to keep the algorithm secret and, in my opinion, \nit may be as much for that as this stated purpose.) The unit key \nwill be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 \nand K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow \nauthorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be \ndecided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that \nthey will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they \nmust be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased. \nWhen a law enforcement agency gets a court order, they will \npresent it to these two escrow authorities and receive K1 and \nK2, thereby allowing access to the unit key UK.\n\nIn addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his \nor her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key \nplain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be \nencrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK, \nand the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part \nmessage which will then be encrypted under the system key SK \nproducing\n\n     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}\n\nWhen a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law \nenforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information \nflowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that \nthey may do this constantly on all links, with or without a \ncourt order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links \nover which a message will flow.] This gives the agency access to \n\n     E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number\n\nin the above message. They then check the serial number \nof the unit and see if it is on the \"watch list\" for which they \nhave a court order. If so, they will decrypt E[K; UK] to obtain K, \nand then decrypt E[M; K] to obtain M.\n\nI am still in the process of assessing this scheme, so please do \nnot take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed \nscheme. All I am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme \nmore knowledgably. But I will say that the need for just one court \norder worries me. I would feel more comfortable (though not \nnecessarily comfortable!) if two separate court orders were \nneeded, one per escrow authority. While no explanation is\nneeded, the following story adds some color: In researching\nsome ideas that Silvio Micali and I have been kicking around,\nI spoke with Gerald Gunther, the constitutional law expert\nhere at Stanford and he related the following story: When\nEdward Levi became Pres. Ford's attorney general (right\nafter Watergate), he was visited by an FBI agent asking\nfor \"the wiretap authorizations.\" When Levy asked for\nthe details so he could review the cases as required by\nlaw, the agent told him that his predecessors just turned\nover 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did not\ncomply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear: \nNo single person or authority should have the power to\nauthorize wiretaps (or worse yet, divulging of personal\nkeys). Sometimes he or she will be an Edward Levi\nand sometimes a John Mitchell.\n\nMartin Hellman\n\n----\n\nDate: Sun, 18 Apr 93 11:41:42 PDT\nFrom: \"Martin Hellman\" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu>\nTo: smb@research.att.com\nSubject: Re: Clipper Chip\n\nIt is fine to post my previous message to sci.crypt \nif you also post this message with it in which:\n\n1.

Satan and his followers have\nrebelled against God, and are not \"children (=followers/redeemed) of God,\"\nbut it doesn't mean that they were not once created by God, but chose to\nseparate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of\nsalvation.\n\n#\n#        The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the\n#        kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked \"one\";\n#        (Matthew 13:38)\n\nkingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of Jesus\n(and have shown \"works of repentance, etc.), and the children of the\nwicked one are those who rebelled against God and the lamb.

First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us\nabout \"the only true God,\" whom you interpret according to your own likes\nand dislikes, but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know about\nHim myself.  I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other\nfaiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a different\nway or fashion than your own.  Not that it really matters, the mission\nand progress of the lds church will go on, boldly and nobly, and no mob\nor opponent can stop the work from progressing, until it has visited\nevery continent, swept every clime, and sounded in every ear.\n\n#  This is really a red herring.

Or: \"what the bible teaches according to\nRobert Weiss and co.?\"  I respect the former, I reject the latter without\nthe remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus.  On the contrary.  And by\nthe way, I do respect your interpretations of the Bible, I even grant you\nbeing a Christian (following your own image of Him), as much as I am a\nChristian (following my own image of Him in my heart).\n\n(...)\n\n#  Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of\n#  Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.'

The indication from Rick is that they may\n#  certainly be.\n\nThe issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis-\nrepresent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of \"official doctrine\"\nis obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial\n(e.g. \"The Seven Deadly Heresies\" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,\nor erroneous at worst (\"blacks not to receive the priesthood in this\ndispensation\").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable\ncontribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal\ninterpretations (his book \"Mormon Doctrine\" is oftentimes referred to\nas \"McConkie's Bible\" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather\nlook to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books!\n(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie\nwas a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of\nGod than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted\ndoctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and\nspeculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most\nbiased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the\ntrash coming from your proverbial pen.

{"text": "I have a question about tires for my Guzzi. It is a '75 850-T. The tires that\nwere on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an\nowners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:\nFront, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and\n33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi\ninstead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run\nat is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.\n\nThe real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for\nthe front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon\nRoadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger\nthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,\nand was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first\nmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner\ntube qualities?\n\nThe above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current\nrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought\n100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be\nvery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.\n\nI am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the\nfront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer \nlasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and\nFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive\nbehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable\nback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving\nmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?\n\nA friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very\ngood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to\nmount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be\ncareful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to\ncheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and\nI havn't had a chance to check the rim type.\n\nOn another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)\nVetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually\nI would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be\nfork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame\nmounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower\nbars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition\nrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly\naccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'\nstyle. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\n\n-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475\n                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

I have repeatedly asked you if the \nIsraelis have less human rights than the palestinians, and if so, why.\nFrom your posting (where you did not directly adress my question) I inferred\nthat you thought so. Together with the above statement I then assumed that the\nreason was the actions of the state of Israel. Re: your statement of \noccupation: I'd like you to define the term, so I don't have to repeat this\n'drag the answer out of hasan' procedure more than neccesary.\n\n   Secondly, surely israeli have human rights, but they ask their goverment to\n   protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories, not by further oppressing\n   Palestinean human rights.\n\nI'm sorry, but the above sentence does not make sense. Please rephrase it.\n\n\n   |> If a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then \n   |> tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?\n\n\n   Because not all states are like Israel, as oppressive, as ignorant, or as tyrant.\n\nOh, ok. So how about the human rights of the Syrians, Iraqis and others?\nDoes the name of Hama sound familiar? Or how about the kurds in Iraq and\nTurkey? \nHow about the Same in Sweden (Ok, maybe a bit farfetched..) the Russians in\nthe Baltic states or the Moslem in the old USSR and Yugoslavia?\nDo the serbs have any human rights remainaing, according to you?\n\n\n   |>    |> And which system do you propose we use to solve the ME problem?\n   |> \n   |>    The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem. Why ? because\n   |>    any system can solve it. \n   |>    The laws of minister Sharon says kick Palestineans out of here (all palestine). \n   |> \n   |> I asked for which system should be used, that will preserve human rights for \n      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n   |> all people involved.

If somebody wishes to\ncounter the reality she described, fine. \n \n[PTS] ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n[PTS] \n[PTS] \n[PTS]       The Conflict Over Nagorno-Karabakh: An Azeri Perspective\n[PTS]       --------------------------------------------------------\n[PTS]                            By Alec Rasizade\n[PTS] \n[PTS] \n\n[AR] Western readers have learned of the Nagorno (Upper) Karabakh\n[AR] controversy through reports from that remote area by Western\n[AR] correspondents and from commentaries by member of the long-established\n[AR] Armenian-American community.  Azeri views on this dispute have\n[AR] appeared rarely if at all in the Western news media.  Therefore let me\n[AR] present _Washington Report_ readers with some basic truths about the\n[AR] origins of the conflict.\n\nDuring the past two years, if one reads all the commentaries on the subject,\na small minority of the writers have been Armenia or Azeri.\n\nThe following should be interesting. \n\n[AR] Armenian leaders claim that Azerbaijan was the first to oppress and\n[AR] expel the Armenian minority from the Azerbaijani Republic.  Actually,\n[AR] the initiative to banish the Azeri minority and convert the Armenian\n[AR] Republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987-1988,\n[AR] when 165,000 Azeris were driven out of Armenia.  Following that move,\n[AR] there were massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani cities of Sumgait\n[AR]in February 1988 and two years later, in Baku in January 1990.\n\nThis not true. Other than simply checking the newspapers, I will quote from an\nindependent human rights report. In the _PAX Cristi Netherlands_, 29 September\n1991, page 28, we read:\n\n \"By mid-november, many incidents took place in several places in\n  Azerbaijan. The APF [Azeri Popular Front] challenged the Communist Party\n  for power. ... After ten days, the authorities came in with tanks to\n  reimpose their power. In Nakhitchevan, the last Armenian villages were\n  deported. In Ganja, Armenians were attacked and killed. All 40,000 \n  Armenian inhabitants fled the city...\"\n\n  Between 22 November and 8 December 1988, refugees from Ganja arrived in\n  Armenia while all 167,000 Azeris in Armenia were chased away.\"\n\nIn this part of the world February 1988 [start of organized anti-Armenian \npogroms in Azerbaijan] come before November and December of 1988!\n\n[AR] Azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that\n[AR] both events were inspired from Moscow to secure Russian imperial rule\n[AR] in the Transcaucasus, according to the Roman principle of \"divide and\n[AR] rule.\"  Similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five-year\n[AR] history of the conflict.\n\nIt is interesting that the Azeris killed, burnt, raped the Armenians but the\nperpetrators blame Russians, and Armenians themselves on other occasions.\n \n[AR] Each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement (in\n[AR] Zheleznovodsk, Moscow, Tehran, Rome, Geneva and Alma-Ata), an\n[AR] invisible hand provoked further bloodshed.  Those interested in\n[AR] maintaining the Azeri-Armenian conflict, as well as the Georgian\n[AR] turmoil, are imperialist forces in Russia, and probably in Iran.\n\nIncorrect! When were the people of Nagorno-Karabakh ever involved in an\nagreement? Never. Until Azerbaijan sits down with the Armenians of Nagorno-\nKarabakh there will never be an end to this conflict.\n \n[AR] The Armenian offensive last spring created more than 100,000 new Azeri\n[AR] refugees from the captured towns of Upper and Lower Karabakh and\n[AR] adjacent rural districts.  Today 500,000 Azeri refugees throng the\n[AR] city of Baku and environs, providing more problems for the newly\n[AR] elected Popular Front government, which is opposed by the rigidly\n[AR] nationalistic National Independence Party.\n \nIt's called war. If the Azerbaijanis didn't try to deport and allow the \nArmenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their ways, keep their Armenian\nculture, these Armenians would not have had to defend their existence. The\nAzeris should not have assumed that Armenians were going to roll over and\nplay dead. \n\n[AR] How can a Western-style democracy survive in a small Muslim country\n[AR] where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed?  In the\n[AR] absence of any international effort to help Azeri refugees, as Kurdish\n[AR] and Bosnian refugees have been helped, how can the Azeri government\n[AR] reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands, homes and\n[AR] possessions?\n\nThe Azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they\nattempted to deprive Armenians of \"lands, homes, and possessions\".\n \n[AR] Such simple realities must be understood in the West.\n[AR] Misunderstanding Caucasian politics leads both Western and Russian\n[AR] public opinion to imagine a permanent, and therefore irreversible,\n[AR] ethnic and religious rivalry in the Caucasus.\n\nTrue, and you, Dr. Alec Rasizade, should practice what you preach!\n \n[AR] I think Western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea.\n[AR] Meanwhile, continuation of the war could draw both Eastern and Western\n[AR] states into the conflict through activation of various security\n[AR] alliances.  These include, on the Armenian side, the Moscow-led\n[AR] Commonwealth forces under the Tashkent mutual security pact, signed\n[AR] May 15, 1992.  On the Azeri side, should Turkey get involved as the\n[AR] guarantor of the Nakhichevan autonomy through the Kars Treaty of Oct.\n[AR] 13, 1921, these include the North Atlantic Treaty forces.\n\nWestern interference! Turkish intervention! The moment Turkey dares step into\nthis conflict it will close the doors of any chance of Turkey being part of \nEurope (as if it ever will) and will destroy the eastern third of Anatolia!\nDr. Rasizade, international realpolitik is not as simple-minded as you would\nhave us believe.\n \n[AR] Upper Karabakh generally is described in Western press reports as an\n[AR]\"Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan.\"  The truth is that the Armenians\n[AR] began to appear there only in the middle of the last century.\n\nIncorrect once again. A brief scan of history addresses such a foolish\nclaim. \n\nArmenians today, refer to the area of Nagorno-Karabakh as \"Artsakh\", which \ncomes from the Urartian term \"Urtekhe-Urtekhini\". NO Azeris yet! \n\nAncient Greeks referred to Artsakh as \"Orkhistena\". NO Azeris yet!\n\nIn the first half of the 6th century B.C., Artsakh, as part of Ervandid\nArmenia of Media. NO Azeris yet!\n\nFrom the end of the 4th century B.C., Artsakh was part of the Armenian Kingdom\nof Ervan. NO Azeris yet!\n\nArtsakh was still part of the Armenian Empire of Tigran. Orkhistena, or \nArtsakh is refereed to by Strabo, as part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!\n\nAfter Armenia was divided between the Persian and Byzantine Empires in 387 \nA.D. until 428, Artsakh was part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!\n\nEnd of the 5th century, Utik and Artsakh became principalities of the \nAranshakhiks. NO Azeris yet!\n\nBy the 7th century an Artsakh dialect of Armenian formed. NO Azeris yet!\n\nEmperor Konstantin (913-959) addressees a letter to the Prince of Khachen \"To\nArmenia\". Khachen was the central principality of Artsakh. NO Azeris yet!\n\nIn the decree of Paul I (1797), the number of Armenian families in this area\nwas stated as 11,000.\n\nIt was from the 16th to the 18th centuries that non-Armenians from Central\nAsia, Asia Minor, and Kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence\nin the planes of Artsakh. Caucasian Muslims around Karabakh!\n\nIn 1813 Karabagh becomes part of Russia. Officiallt part of Russia 1828. Some \nMuslims in Karabakh!\n\nIn 1914, the number of Armenian churches in Nagorno-Karabagh was 224, 188\npriests, 206,768 parishioners in 224 Armenian towns and villages. The Armenian\npercentage of the population was over 90%. MAX: 10% Azeris in Karabakh --\nassuming no Kurds!\n\nConsider the following statement by the Azerbaijani Revcom on December 1, 1920:\n\n \"The Worker-Peasant Government of Azerbaidzan, having been informed of the\n  proclamation of Armenia a Soviet Socialist Republic, sends its greetings\n  to the brother people. From this day the previous boundaries between\n  Armenia and Azerbaidzan are annulled. Nagornyi Karabakh, Zangezur, and\n  Nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the Armenian Socialis\n  Republic.\n\n  Long live the brotherhood and union of the workers and peasants of Soviet\n  Armenia and Azerbaidzan!\n\n\t\t\t\tChairman of the Revcom of Azerbaidzan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tN. Narimanov\n\n\t\t\t\tPeople's Commissar for Foreign Affairs\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGuseinov\"\n\n[AR] A few years ago they celebrated the 150th anniversary of their\n[AR] resettlement from Persia to Karabakh, after it came under Russian\n[AR] rule. \n\nNo, incorrect. The 1988 celebration was the 150th anniversary of Russian rule\nin the Caucasus, including Karabakh!\n\n[AR] At the same time the Russian colonial administration also drew\n[AR] in Russian and German settlers, who were welcomed by Azeris.  How\n[AR] would Americans react if the large numbers of Armenians living in\n[AR] southern California suddenly claimed an Armenian homeland, and\n[AR] demanded separation from California?\n\nNon-sequitur. \n \n[AR] Armenian historians insist that before the Armenian resettlement\n[AR] Karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal Christians.  That is correct.\n\nArmenian historians don't say this!\n\n[AR] The people of medieval Caucasian Albania adopted Christianity in the\n[AR] fourth century.  But those ancient residents had no link to and\n[AR] nothing in common with Armenians.\n\nConsidering the Caucasian Albans were of the Armenian Apostolic faith, and\ntheir utilization of the Armenian language in their liturgy, makes such an \nargument totally invalid!\n\n[AR] Azeris would have a better claim to\n[AR] be successors of Albania, since Azeris have for centuries inhabited,\n[AR] dominated, and developed the Karabakh part of the Azeri nation.\n\nWishing to be part of a people non-existent for nearly a millennium for geo-\npolitical advantage is rather outrageous. In addition to such absurdity,\nAzeris claim to be Turks, Persians, and all the while are Azerizing their\nminorities, such as the Lezgians, Kurds, Tat, Talish, and a host of other\nnationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of Azerbaijan.\n\n[AR] Both Armenia and Azerbaijan last year signed the Final Act of the\n[AR] Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of 1975, and the\n[AR] Paris Charter for New Europe of 1990, confirming their mutual\n[AR] adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders.  This\n[AR] principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the\n[AR] Republic of Azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory\n[AR] nations, not just by Turkey.\n\nSuch agreements do not give Azerbaijan the right to de-populate Karabakh of\nArmenians.\n \n[AR] This is one key to intervention on behalf either of the U.N., the\n[AR] CSCE, the Commonwealth, NATO or Iran.  The second key to untying the\n[AR] Caucasian knot is to determine who is the aggressor, according to the\n[AR] U.N. definition of 1974.\n\nFine, so why has Azerbaijan refused to allow UN troops into the Armenian\nenclave? What is Azerbaijan afraid of? Perhaps the fact that the territory\nis the home of Armenians, the UN, would by definition, support the local\npopulation! \n \n[AR] When that is accomplished, the international community can and should\n[AR] apply to the aggressor in the Caucasus international sanctions such as\n[AR] those presently being employed against Serbia and Montenegro in the\n[AR] former Yugoslavia.  Such decisive collective international action can\n[AR] halt further aggression in Karabakh, and prevent the Armenian-Azeri\n[AR] conflict from growing and spreading.\n \nAzerbaijan's refusal to allow the Armenians of Karabakh to determine their\nown future the is issue, not viewing isolating events out of context are \nactions that will address the Karabakh conflict. Viewing events in a war\nin isolation and out of context is like viewing the landing at Normandy as\nan act of Allied aggression! \n \n[AR] Dr. Alec Rasizade, senior research officer at the Academy of Sciences\n[AR] of Azerbaijan, is a visiting researcher at the Harriman Institute of\n[AR] Columbia University in New York.\n\nHa!\n\n ", "label": 17}

{"text": "From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: Zionism - racism\n\n\nDiaspora 'a cancer'\n------------------- by Julian Kossoff and Lindsay Schusman in:\nJewish Chronicle, London, 22. Dec. 1989\n\nLeading Israeli author and cultural commentator, A.B. Yehoshua,\nlaunched a ferocious attack on diaspora Jewry at a Zionist Youth\nCouncil meeting in North London, last week.\n\nThe diaspora, he claimed, \"was the cancer connected to the main\ntissue of the Jewish people\". He was scathing about its failure to\nact before the Holocaust.\n\nHe said the diaspora's religious and secular leadership had\nignored the warning signs in the 1920s, and had fiercely opposed\nZionism. Consequently, he considered the Holocaust, \"the failure\nof Judaism\".\n\nHis talk, entitled \"Diaspora: A Neurotic Solution\", covered 5,000\nyears of Jewish history.\n\nMr. Yehoshua's other targets included Soviet Jews who were, he\nsaid \"not staying [in Israel], but running [away]\", and all Jews\noutside Israel \"who were using other people's countries like\nhotels\".\n\nThe only conclusion he could draw was that the diaspora was\nimmoral, because it looked to Israel for its identity but lived\nelsewhere.\n\nWorse, it threatened Israel itself, creating a distraction for her\ncitizens, who were leaving by the thousands.\n\nMr. Yehoshua, who described himself as \"a soldier for aliyah\",\nended by calling for the creation of a new \"total Jew\", living in\nIsrael.\n\nEarlier, speaking at a meeting of Jewish students on the\ndifficulties of forging a national identity in Israeli literature,\nMr. Yehoshua claimed that Israeli writers were paralyzed by the\ncountry's political situation.\n\nHe said Israel's wars had once provided writers with a vital\nsource of inspiration.  Today, Israeli writers avoided writing\ndirectly about the Arab-Israeli conflict. No major work had been\nproduced about the intifada.\n\nInstead, writers were tackling themes such as Jewish identity,\nemigration from Israel and personal and family issues.\n\nMr. Yehoshua admitted he also felt unable to write about the\nIsraeli political situation. He could no longer step into an\nIsraeli Arab's shoes and portray him as a real \"flesh and blood\ncharacter\".\n\nHe claimed that after 40 years of statehood, the problem of\nIsraeli identity had not been solved. He said Jews remained too\npre-occupied with the borders of identity between Jew and non-Jew,\nand were not concerned with the nature of that identity.\n\nJewish values in Israel embraced every aspect of daily life,\nunlike in the diaspora, where Jews had no responsibility for the\ncountry they lived in, he said.\n\nHe warned that modern Hebrew, a unifying force for the Jewish\npeople, would have to struggle for its future, especially in\nliterary circles. It faced fierce competition from the English\nlanguage.\n", "label": 17}

Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals.\nBrian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good\ngoaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the\nstretch to preserve the Blues lead.\n\nThe Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 and\ntaking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penalty\non Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the\nblue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired\na long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. After\nthe goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks\n10-9 in the first period.\n\nJeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on\nthe left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour\ncame out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Brown\ncollected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.\n\nTwo minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a\nshort-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy\nRoenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass\nacross the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead.\n\nNoonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1.\nStephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat\nStephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan\ndeflected the puck in the net.\n\nDenny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the\nrebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for\nthe shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards\nto Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues\noutshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period.\n\nWith the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, Stephane Matteau picked\nup a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith\nwas called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07.\n\nThe Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into\nthe two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot,\nand Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and\npassed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp\nangle.\n\nJust 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Nelson\nEmerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with\ntwo Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the\nslot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3.\n\nThe Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but Joseph\nmade some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped Troy\nMurray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game.\nThe Blues killed off a late Hawks power play, with Rich Sutter clearing the\npuck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues held\non to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period,\ntotaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent\nin the game. The Blues killed 6 of 7 Hawks power plays, and scored twice on\non four power play chances. The Blues ranked among the best special teams in\nthe league. They rank 2nd in penalty killing and 3rd on the power play.\n \nThe game was carried live on ABC, the first time an NHL game other than an\nAll-Star game has been shown on network television since May 24, 1980, when\nCBS carried Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals.\n\nThe best-of-seven series continues Wednesday in Chicago and Friday and Sunday\nin St. Louis.\n\nBox score\n---------\nBlues 4, Blackhawks 3\n\nBLUES       0    2    2   --   4\nCHICAGO     1    2    0   --   3\n\nFIRST PERIOD\n\n   CHI -- Noonan 1 (Larmer, K.Brown), 8:17.\n\n   Penalties -- Shanahan, StL (holding), 2:28; Zombo, StL (interference), 6:00;\nMurphy, Chi (high-sticking), 11:30; Grimson, Chi (boarding), 14:39; Zombo, StL\n(holding), 18:46.\n\nSECOND PERIOD\n\n   STL -- Brown 1 (Shanahan, Emerson), 3:12.\n   CHI -- (PPG) Noonan 2 (Roenick, Chelios), 5:40.\n   CHI -- Noonan 3 (Matteau, Sutter), 8:51.\n   STL -- Felsner 1 (McRae, Janney), 12:49.\n\n   Penalties -- Baron, StL (interference), 4:33; Wilson, StL (tripping), 9:31.\n\nTHIRD PERIOD\n\n   STL -- (PPG) Shanahan 1 (J.Brown, Hull), 11:12.\n   STL -- (PPG) Hull 1 (Emerson, J.Brown), 11:29.\n\n   Penalties -- Shanahan, StL (roughing), 1:54; Matteau, Chi (high-sticking),\n9:56; Smith, Chi (slashing), 10:49; Baron, StL (roughing), 14:23.\n\nSHOTS ON GOAL\n\nBLUES       10    10     7   --   27\nCHICAGO      9     5    13   --   27\n\nPower-play Opportunities -- St. Louis 2 of 4; Chicago 1 of 7.\n\nGoaltenders -- St. Louis, Joseph, 1-0-0 (27 shots-24 saves).\n               Chicago, Belfour, 0-1-0 (27-23).\n\nReferee -- Kerry Fraser.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\ndrawings.\n\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\nrespectively.\n\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\nthe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\ninvisible to the eye.\n\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\nfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\naren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\n\n\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\n\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\n\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\n\nIf your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\n\nIt's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\nextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\n\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\n\n\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\n\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\n\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\nby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\n\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\nparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.\n\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\n\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\n\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\na GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\nconvert well.\n\n\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\n\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B.\n\nFile\t   Size in bytes\t\tComments\n\nship.ppm\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\n\t\t\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\nship.ppm.Z\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\n\t\t\t compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.\n\t\t\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\nship.gif\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\n\t\t\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\n\t\t\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\n\nship.jpg95\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\n\t\t\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\n\t\t\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\nship.jpg75\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\n\t\t\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\n\t\t\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\nship.jpg50\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\n\t\t\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\n\t\t\t for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing\n\t\t\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\n\t\t\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\nship.jpg25\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\n\t\t\t JPEG's characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\n\t\t\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\n\t\t\t Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\n\t\t\t of poorer image quality than this.\nship.jpg5o\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\n\t\t\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\n\t\t\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\n\t\t\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\n\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\nratio for real-world scenes.\n\n\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\n\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\nit's not a percentage of anything.\n\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\n\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\n\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\n\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\n\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\nquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\n\n\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\n\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\nIf you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\n(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\nthe news.answers archive.\n\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\n\n\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\n\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\nkind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\n\nX Windows:\n\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\nmanipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\n\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\nbasic free JPEG software.\n\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\n\n\nMS-DOS:\n\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\n\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\nnot flashy, but it's functional.\n\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\n\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\nVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\nthat the driver is missing.)\n\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\nthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\n\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:\nit's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\n\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*\nof them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\nhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\nthing with hi-color displays.)\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\n\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\nparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\n\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\n\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\n\nMicrosoft Windows:\n\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\ndue to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\n\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\nBut it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\n\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG\nfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\n\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\n286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\n\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\n\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\nmode, not in a window.\n\nOS/2:\n\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip\n    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip\n    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing\n    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed\n    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.\n\nMacintosh:\n\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\n\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\n\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\nlike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very\nwell thought out.\n\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\n\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\n\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\n\nApple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\nit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\n\nStorm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\ndownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\n\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\ndon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\n\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\nJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\n\nAmiga:\n\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\n\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\n\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\n\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\n\nIf you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\n\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\nit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\n\nAtari ST:\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\n\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.\n\nI have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for\nAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.\n\nAcorn Archimedes:\n\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\n\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\n\nThere's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\n\n\nPortable software for almost any system:\n\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\n\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.\n\n\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\n\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\nIf you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\n(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\n\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\nprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have\ntested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.\n\nWe have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.\nCompanies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.\nWe do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in\nproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).\nWe hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with\nanything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to\ncontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.\n\n\n[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?\n\nMost people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.\nTypical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display\n256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We're stuck with\nthe standard usage though.)\n\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\n\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\nThis happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\n\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\n(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\nnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)\n\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\npalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\nFurthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization\nalgorithm, you're out of luck.\n\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\nfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.\nJPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was\nsent.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\n\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\nin a machine-independent fashion.\n\n\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\n\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\ncoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\n\n\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\n\nThere's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\n\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\n\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\nvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\n\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\n\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\n\n\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\n\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\nstandards organizations.\n\nSince we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with\nanybody else's.\n\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\nthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\n    pixels and not much else.\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\nof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\n\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\n\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\n\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\n\n\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\n\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\n\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.\n\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\n    it's worth a try, anyway.\n\n3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\n    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\n\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\n\n5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\n    try stripping off everything before that.\n\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM_]C_X ...\n\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM:'-I ...\n\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\n\n\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\n\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\n\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\nat best.)\n\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\n\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\n\n\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\n\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\nfirst time around.\n\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\nfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\n\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\n(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\nthat's a mighty limited capability!)\n\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\ntransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\n\n\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\n\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\nloss of quality.\n\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\ndon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\n\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\nDon't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\n\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\nsystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\nway to do this.)\n\ncjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\n\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\ncolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\nthan you'd get without smoothing.\n\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\nthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\n\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\nimage, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\n\n\n---------------------\n\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\n", "label": 1}

{"text": "Here's a summary of Don Cherry's Coach's Corner from April 23, 1993.\nIt was taken from a tape delay of a Vancouver-Winnipeg game, but\nit was filmed during the Toronto-Detroit game that night. I think\nit was also shown during the Calgary-LA game. \n\n(Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)\n\nTopics\n------\n\nDon's Tie, Doug Gilmour, Wings/Leafs, Quebec/Montreal, Boston/Buffalo,\nWendel Clark, Fighting and Stickwork.\n\nEpisode Summary\n---------------\n\nOnce again, the episode started with a shot of Don's tie... This\nwas a different tie than last time. Don pointed out some of the\ncharacters on the tie, but gave them different names... Felix the\nCat (Sylverster), Maclean (Daffy Duck), etc.\n\nRon Maclean asked Don what he thought of the current Wings-Leafs\ngame. Don thought it was good. Burns told the Leaf players \"They\nwon in their building, we're going to win in ours\".\n\nDon then began to praise Gilmour again. Don pointed out that Gilmour\nhas never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since he\ngot 5 points in a game against St. Louis.  (Don also claims that\nhe gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour, which was partly responsible\nfor his good play.) Several clips were then shown of Gilmour\nfrom the series... A hit on Constantinov, and a pass to Andrewchuk\nresulting in a goal.\n\nOn the game itself, the Wings were taking a lot of penalties in\nthe first period. The Wings have enough talent to score short handed\nhowever, and when the Leafs get a power play, Coach Burns tells\nthe Leaf players \"Don't let them score on you\".\n\nRon brought up the previous Quebec-Montreal game. [Note: Montreal\nwon that game in overtime, despite having a possible game winner\ndisqualified because it was batted in with a high stick.] Don\nthought the high stick was obvious, even without the use of\ninstant replay.\n\nOn the Buffalo-Boston series [Note: Buffalo is currently winning\nthe series 3-0], Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr.\nFuhr should be getting 1/2 the team's playoff checks for his\nplay.\n\nWendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performance\nduring the Detroit-Toronto series. Don defended him, by saying\nthat he can't play the way he should, because of the league's\nnew rules. \"This used to be a rough and tough league... Now its\nall hack and slash.\" Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for the\nproblems.\n\nDon's opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by Wings\nGM and coach Bryan Murray. A clip from a news conference by Murray\nwas shown, in which Murray made statements claiming the elimination\nof fighting increases stickwork. Don also read a newspaper article\nin which Murray makes the following statements: \"Players don't fight\nbecause they're afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator.\nInstead, they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing\neach other. Is this what the fans want to see? I guarantee there\nwouldn't be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game.\"\n\nDon warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to \"smarten up\" with\nfighting in hockey. He went on to say that before, there used\nto be one guy cut with a high stick in a series. Now, with no fights,\nsomeone gets cut every period.\n\nRating\n------\nTypical anti-fighting posturing, but here Don's opinion is supported\nby Murray.", "label": 10}

If anything bad is possible by the government in theory, it\nalmost always ends up happening in fact.  So the key is to make abuse\nIMPOSSIBLE.  Question authority, and remember power DOES corrupt.\n\nI think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it WILL be\nexpanded to include other data forms, such as data transfer and stored\ndata. and as such should be treated as if it were expanded (or such\nexpansion will be almost impossible to stop, using Clipper as a precident).\nThere was a hint of that in the proposal, remember.  That said, please\nbear with me, I am not very articulate, so I take more words to say\nwhat others could say much more briefly.  Thank you.\n\n\nAs I suggested this is NOW.  The hint is in the proposal that this or\nsimilar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions\nsuch as data transfer, data files, and such, largely dependent on how\nthis thing is accepted or flies.  I think one would be wise to treat\nthis in the manner one would when (not if) it gets expanded to other\nareas than cellular phones.  I think this is guaranteed to happen, if\nthis proposal gets by.  Salami politics.  It has been and is used in\nseveral other areas, it is certain to be used here.  Government is not\ngoing to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop\nwhenever they want to.  'Court order required' has proven to be a rather\nflimsy guarantee.  If the case warrants, they can always sieze the\nmaterial, and force one to give the key, or sit in jail forever on\nperiodically renewed contempt charges.  So it is not denying the justice\nsystem the information, nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty\n(or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is not\nprotected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that would\nresult in divulging incriminating evidence).  So, blocking restrictions\non private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - it\ndoes make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult.  Especially\nfishing expeditions without the target's knowlege.  Don't give up the\nright to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable, and Clinton\nand Co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing,\nfiguring if they get it this far, they can ram it on through).  How come\nthose consulted could be roughly described as \"us insiders\"?  They cannot\nquietely IMPLIMENT it though, when they ban other schemes to ensure its\nexclusive use.  Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone.\nDon't buy into it.  Has government really earned that kind of trust,\npast or future?  To be secure and free, one must keep government honest\nand the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE, not 'unlikely'\nor 'difficult'.\n\n\nSo what?  One could use information gained by re-use of the keys (saved\nafter the last case was finished) or other means (master key, backdoor,\neasily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which, given to a judge,\nwould authorize a tap which wouldn't have been possible otherwise.  This\nhas been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past...  For\nlocal cops, this might be workable to keep them honest, but the Feds\nhave a workaround somehow, BET on it.  Does anyone really believe\nfor example, that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen\nin on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or\nvia a 'master key'?  I sure don't.\n\nThis whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use\nold-fashioned police work to build a case.  In the past, eavesdropping\nwas rather easy (with or without a court order).  I think the Law\nEnforcement community has become a bit spoiled, and will resist changes\nthat require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work.  I\njust find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much\nabout civil and individual rights, that \"puts people first\".  The question\nis \"put people first\" to WHERE?\n\nWith the innards not being revealed, how is one to be sure there DOESN'T\nexist a 'master key' for use by NSA, etc (so they can do their keyword\nscan, etc on conversations they routinely monitor, without a specific\ncourt order)?   Remember, the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY.\nBet on it.  And so far I have not heard about police telling people that\nthey have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found.  What is to\nkeep them from simply keeping the keys on file for 'next time'? After\nawhile, they would have quite a collection.  Kept especially for folks\nthey deem 'disruptive'.  And if they get only one key, that would\nreduce the search space a lot, unless it is an RSA scheme.  Remember\nNixon years?  Need for court orders really slowed them down, didn't it?\n\nAnd unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled (fat chance!\nI see one ending up being under, say Treasury, the other under Justice\n:-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to\na competitor's Clinton Clipper (or descendent when this idea is expanded\nto be used for all non-government encryption).  Enough bucks would get\none the keys or the innards for this algorithm.  Perhaps not an important\nconcern, but given past government behavior and the other problems...\n\n\nWhat will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption?  You\ncan BET that if Clipper is accepted, that will be next on the agenda.\nIt is even hinted at in the proposal - read it carefully...  Expect the\nargumet \"well, if you got nothing to hide...\"  Fine. Then using that\nargument, one should not object to video cameras being installed in\nevery room of one's home.  Granted - an exteme expansion of the idea but\nthe principle holds.  Private stuff should remain private, even from a\ngovt fishing expedition.  And laws/rules may change in the future as\nto 'safeguards'.  When it comes to the Fed Government, safeguards are\npretty meaningless, if they want to do/get something.\n\nDon't work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights, or establish\nbad precidents, please.  The price could be hell to pay, later.\n\n\nPeople would fight laws forbidding more NOW, but in, say two years,\nbecause we have this 'crisis' situation which MUST be addressed by some\n'drastic action', just this added reasonable restriction will only bother\nthose who have someting to hide... etc.  Please don't buy into it.\n\nIf the Clinton Clipper is so very good, why not make its algrithm public\nso many people can exchange ideas and examine it, rather than a few\nisolated 'respected experts' (respected by whom?  for what?  Perhaps a\ncertain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected\nexperts... this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was\nadvocating, if I recall :-).  How would anybody know that what the\nexperts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the Clipper\nChip, if it is kept secret?   Perhaps the Clipper will use a crippled\nversion (with a 'master key' provision), or features not present in the\nversion subjected for study and evaluation by the experts.  And who\nchooses the expertes?  The government?  No conflict of interest there...\n:-)\n\nAnd isn't it a REQUIREMENT for any decent encryption scheme that it NOT\nhave its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known?\nI was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything\nyou have, except for the key(s)... I recall ideas presented to this\ngroup are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret...\n\nAnother question - since it is a safe bet this Clipper thing would not\nbe used for government security, they are regarding it as not real secure\nbut \"good enough\" for common folk.  I think I would like to see a full\ndescription (not a PR non-statement) of just what \"good enough\" means?\nI think when saying how strong it is, \"good enough\" really means \"not\nvery\".  The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not\nacceptable:  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and\nConstitution (which the people, not the governments, of those other\ncountries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as\nrevokable privileges).  And if we expect to retain those rights and\nprotections, we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA\nhave this thing to 'fight crime'.  We have allready have our Bill of\nRights pretty much torn to shreds.  We should not permit more weakining\nfor yet another 'noble cause', instead we should be trying to repair\nthe damage.  Our crime problem may have a number of causes, but \"too\nmany rights and safeguards\" is not a signifigant one.  A broken court\nsystem and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having\n\"too many rights\" (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime,\netc).\n\nBTW - those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton, believe\nthis:  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed\nthis thing.  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights\nunder the Constitution or Bill of Rights.  The last couple of decades\nhave been a non-stop series of end-runs around the protections of the\nConstitution.  It has to stop.  Now is as good a time as any, if it\nisn't too late allready.\n\n\n", "label": 11}

{"text": "ZOROASTRIANISM\nSAN JOSE, CA, USA\nMonday April 5, 1993\nSan Jose Mercury News, Page 1\n     [Reproduced without permission]\n\n_3,700-year tradition still glows - \n           'Assimilation in U.S. threatens ancient Zoroastrian religion'_\n\nBy Jeanne Huber, Mercury News Staff Writer\n\n   HIGH ON A HILLSIDE above San Jose, flames leap up 24 hours a day from a\ngleaming brass urn in a temple - one of only four in the United States -\ndedicated to one of the world's most ancient religions.\n\n   With the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 Bay Area Zoroastrians that\ntheir faith will survive this land.\n\n   \"There is a fear - a real fear, too,\" said Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette.\n\"We have one generation to do it or to die.\"\n\n   Many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land.\nBut for Zoroastrians, it is an especially poignant concern.\n\n   Their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years, a heritage so deep\nit scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where \"historical sites\" are\nsometimes less than 100 years old.  It was the religion of the great Persian\nEmpire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ\nwas born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three\nZoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians,\nJews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the\nZoroastrian prophet.\n\n   Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are \na miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a\npeople is very much on their minds.\n\n   Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance\nof the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed\nby nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause\ntheir young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.\n\n   Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they\nactually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children\nbecome totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather than\nthe world at large - who will be the losers.\n\n   \"It's important to have an identity,\" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose,\na leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  \"It's important\nfor everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life.\nYou don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect.\nYou can fall back on your own identity.\"\n\n   For Zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of.\n\n   Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which\nanimal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was\nonly one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which\ntranslates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.\n\n_Good vs. evil_\n\n   Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with\nthe good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for\ngood, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences\nsuch as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity,\nkindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of\nmen and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.\n\n   But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to\nfollow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact,\nJoseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths,\ntraced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.\n\n   Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a\nstained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of\nMount Hamilton, is \"Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\"\n\n   So it's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India,\nwhere a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape\npersecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy;\nthe overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.\n\n   About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India\nand Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from\nIran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state\nwhere others had no rights.\n\n   Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on \"good\ndeeds\" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose,\nthe recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because\nManou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up\ndowntown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple's\ndedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the\nZoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n   The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an\nIranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples\nin North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount\nHamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto,\nand Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on\nthis continent.\n\n   Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the\nproperty already had a large house that they have converted to a\ncommunity center.\n\n   The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet \nZoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted \nceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.\n\n   Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed-\nin area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are \nsometimes called \"fire worshippers,\" they actually consider fire just \na symbol of God.  \"It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the \ncross and Muslims use the Holy Book,\" Bhujwala said.\n\n   The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all\nIranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of\nthe season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With\nZoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religious\nand secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the\nUnited States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.\n\n  For this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 people\ncame to worship and revel.\n\n   \"The good things in life are not forbidden,\" Esfandiar Anoushiravani,\na leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed\nproved him right.\n\n   Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood\naround the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted\nthanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking\nsandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit\nand nuts.\n\n   Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  \"People eat the\nfruit,\" Tarapore said.  \"It's a way to participate in the ceremony.\"\n\n_Santa Claus, sort of_\n\n   The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing white\nhair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore green\nsymbolic of spring) and red.\n\n   He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced and\nplayed a tambourine.\n\n   The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  \"This is all new for us, too,\"\none told a visitor who asked what was going on.\n\n   A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with\nthe religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have\nno procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their\ncenturies of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu\nking who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his\npeople's religion.\n\n   But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the\nSan Jose temple whenever he can.\n\n   \"When I first heard about this religion,\" he said, \"I thought, my God,\nthis is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.\n\n   \"People who don't have a tradition, something to lean on, what's the\ndifference with the lower animals?\"", "label": 19}

More and more I see the government slowly washing\n<away privacy.  Even unwittingly.  Do you think I will ever live in a\n<soceity that issues smart cards to citizens at birth?  Do you think I\n<will live in a soceity that insists I register my crypto keys so they\n<can keep track of what I'm saying?  Even if there is no evidence of my\n<guilt?  Do you think I will ever live in a soceity that seeks to meddle\n<in the affairs of its' citizenry without recourse of any kind?  I'm tired\n<of it.  There is (IMHO) no compromise with an administration that seeks\n<to implement these proposals under the guise of enhancing privacy.\n<\n<More than the proposals themselves, I read the language of the press\n<releases, the obvious deception involved in presenting these pieces to\n<the public, and I am sickened.  I am revolted.  I am repulsed.\n<\n<90%, perhaps even 95% of this country could care less about the\n<clipper chip, the wiretap bill, the smart card, because they are so\n<entrapped in the rhetoric of the Clinton Administration.\n\nThe problem is, the people are not having the scope, or implicataions\npointed out to them.  Hell, most haven't even heard of Clipper, and\nwhen they do, it will be in soothing language telling everyone how\nnice the government is at 'letting them have' privacy.\n\nHow come the media is not telling about the provisions of the Clipper\ndecision?

The abuses of Civil Forfeiture?\nThe government uses polls to support 75 percent of the people want\ngun bans, etc., yet the same pollsters have determined (according to\nthe media) that 30 percent of the people are unaware of what the Holocaust\nis...\n\nThe people cannot be expected to give decent decisions when they are\ndenied the information that all these abuses and whittling away of\nrights are going on quietly.  When they find out (when it hits them),\nit will be too late.  One cannot expect each citizen to spend all their\ntime probing, searching, researching, etc.   For example, how big a\npercentage of the average population even has access to USENET?

{"text": "Some  people working a few cubes over have come up with this need, and\nit seems that someone out there just might have done it  already,  and\ncan point me to some tools that would help. What they'd like to do is:\nGiven a window that is taking a long time to draw (because either  the\ndata  is  arriving  over a slow link, or the $DISPLAY is across a slow\nlink), they would like to first paint a low-resolution version of  the\npicture,  and then repaint it in higher resolution.  Thus, the picture\nmight first be generated in 1/4 resolution, with each  4x4  square  of\npixels  being  filled  in  with a single color.  Next, each 4x4 square\nwould be replaced by 4 2x2 squares; finally the 1x1 version  would  be\npainted.\n\nSince  one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other side\nof a slow link, the low-res version obviously wouldn't be  transmitted\nas  a bitmap; that wouldn't help at all.  Instead, there would have to\nbe a process on the far end that receives the  low-res  picture  as  a\nsmall  bitmap,  and  blows up each pixel into a square (sorta like the\nmagnifier programs do).  This brings up the question of whether the  X\nserver  can help.  That is, when a window is opened, is there a way to\nask that a \"filter\" program be run to process the pixels?  Or  is  the\nonly  way  to  use  something  like  rsh  to start up a remote process\n(\"Permission denied\" ;-), and have it open a local window?\n\nIt seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts  up\nsuch  a  program  remotely, and then accepts bitmaps, compressing each\none by some amount, and sending them to the remote program to  expand.\nBut  if  there is something that X itself can do to help, it's be nice\nto hear about it.  (I looked in several FMs,  but  if  it's  there,  I\nobviously  don't  know  the keywords ;-).  If someone has a nifty tool\navailable that packages it all, we might want to get a copy.\n\nOh, yes; this is to run on some Suns.  Part of the idea  is  to  build\ndemos  that  can  show such things as \"If this were run across, say, a\n4800-bps link, this is how fast the pictures would appear.\"  Then  the\ncustomer would get a feel for the speed that they need to pay for.\n", "label": 5}

And I was shocked to hear that our bible study teacher\nsaid that Mohammad was indeed a prophet but of Satan. I said, \"What??\"\nI did not believe that, because I have some moslem friends who are\nso kind and  nice, even sometimes I feel I wish I could be like them\n(in my point of view, they don't sin as much as I do). How come if they\nwere under Satan, they could have such personalities. \n\nTo tell you the truth, I don't know much about Islam.\nBut I know that they believe in God, they believe in the day of\njudgement.\n\t\n\tNow I'm  asking you what your opinions about Islam and \nits teaching. \n\nIMPORTANT : I do not want to discuss whether they are saved or not.\n\t    I do not want to discuss about politic related to Islam.\n\nP.S: I post this in bit.listserv.christia, soc.religion.christian,\n     and bit.listserv.catholic.\n\n\nIn Christ, our Lord,                           Smile.........\n\t\t\t\t\t       Jesus loves you.......\n\tTabut Torsina\n\tTORSINA@ENUXHB.EAS.ASU.EDU\t   \n\n[Let me start by saying that this is not the right newsgroup for a\ndiscussion of Islam, since there's a group for that.  But I suspect\nthe point your teacher was making was not specifically about Islam.\nIndeed it's going to be impossible to see what he was getting at\nwithin your groundrules, since the question of whether non-Christians\nare saved is at the heart of it.\n\nThe classic Christian view, which I think most people believed until\nthe last century or so, was that Christianity (and of course Judaism)\nwas the only religion founded by God, and that all other religions\nworshipped false gods, and came from Satan.  This is more or less a\ncorollary of another traditional view that no one but Christians (and\npossibly Jews) will be saved.  This need not mean that there's no\ntruth in any other religion, nor that all of their members are\nintentionally Satanic.  After all, in order to be an effective snare,\nSatanic alternatives would have to be attractive.  Thus they might\ncontain all kinds of truth, wisdom and spiritual insights.  They would\nbe missing only one thing -- knowledge of salvation through Christ.\nIf this is the background of your teacher's remarks -- and I suspect\nit is -- that means that a discussion of Islam is not necessarily\nrelevant.  The point is not that there's anything intrinsically wrong\nwith it.  It may teach a fine code of behavior, and its practitioners\nmay all be wonderful people.  But if salvation requires being a\nfollower of Christ, it could still be a Satanic invention.\n\nThis is a reasonable deduction from the classic Protestant position.\nChristianity says that salvation isn't a matter of being kind and\nnice.  Those are good things, and we should encourage them.  But no\none is able to do them enough to be saved.  Salvation requires Christ.\n(Please forgive me for doing this in Protestant terms.  There's a\nCatholic equivalent to this that has similar implications, but in\ndifferent terms.)  A religion may be quite attractive in all visible\nways.  But if it doesn't have Christ, it's like a diet that consists\nof food that looks wonderful, tastes great, but is missing some\nessential food element so that you end up dying.\n\nLet me be clear that I am not specifically advocating this position.\nWhat I'm trying to do is (as usual) to clarify issues.  Indeed it is\nnow relatively uncommon for Christians to believe that all other\nreligions are Satanic.  Most Christians regard such beliefs as an\nunfortunate vestige of the past.  This is part of a general move\nwithin Christianity in the last century or so to a non-judgemental\nGod.  Christians now find it hard to believe that God would allow\nanybody other than a really rotten person to end up in hell, and they\nfind it hard to envision that real malignant spiritual forces are at\nwork in the world doing things like creating superficially attractive\nalternatives to Christianity.  Whether there is actually a sound basis\nfor the shift is a decision that people need to make for themselves.", "label": 15}

{"text": "\n\nI will answer this as I find time.\n\n\nNotice what I said about this book.  I called it \"Easy reading.\"  The reason I\ndropped philosphy as my major was because I ran into too many pharisaical\nSimon's.  I don't know how many walking encyclopedia's I ran across in\nphilosphy classes.  The problem isn't in knowing sooooo much more than your\naverage lay person, the problem comes when you become puffed up about it. \nSchaeffer is just fine for the average lay person.  That was who he was\nwritting to.  I suppose that you would have criticised John that his gospel was\nto simple.  I've talked with Schaeffer one on one.  I've been in lectures with\nthe man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and prof's from secular\nas well as Christian universities. (ND alone would fill both those catagories) \nHis answers were enough that the prof's themselves often were taken back and\ncaused to re-think what their question was.  I saw this time and time again at\ndifferent open forums.  So yes, Schaeffers books are by in large, well,\nsimplistic.  It certainly isn't grad level reading.  But we must get off our\nhigh horses when it comes to recommended reading.  Do you seriously think most\npeople would get through the first chapter of Wittgenstein?  I may have more to\nsay about this secular scientist at another time.\n\nAlso, one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by *insistent*\ninquisitiveness.  One cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt\nbase.  \n\nLook, the Christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality.  But we must\nadd a qualification to give this balance.  Christianity is second to none in\nkeeping reason in its place.  We never know the value of a thing until we know\nits limits.  Put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust\nit of all value!\n\nTHis is why Xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic.\n It also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism, and not Christian\nfaith, which leads to irrationality.  If we forget the limits of a thing, we\nfly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic\nlesson of life: \n\n\"More without limits is less;  less with limits is more.\"  \n\nOr as I have so often stated it, freedom without form soon becomes form w/o\nfreedom.\n\nLet's put it another way.  The rationality of faith is implacably opposed to\nabsurdity but has no quarrel with mystery. Think about that.  It can tell the\ndifference between the two if you will let it.  Christianity's contention with\nrationalism is not that it has too much reason in it, but that it has very\nlittle else.  When a Christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust\ngo hand in hand, but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called\nto go on by itself without his understanding.\n\nThis is where the principle of suspended judgment applies.  At such time if the\nChristian faith is to be itself and let God be God, it must suspend judgment\nand say, \"Father I do not understand you but I trust you.\"  Now don't read all\nyour objections of me into that statement.  I wasn't saying I do not understand\nyou at all, but I trust you anyway.\" It means that \"I do not understand You *in\nthis situation* but I do understand *why I trust You* anyway\"  Therefore I can\ntrust that you understand even though I do not. The former is a mystery\nunrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity.  The latter is\na statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of\nFaith.  So.... the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational.  It is\nnot a leap of faith but a walk of faith.  As believers we cannot always know\nwhy, but we canalways know why we trust God who knows why and this makes all\nthe difference.\n\nNow, there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where I have parted\ncompany with philosophy- what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit\nmore difficult in practice.  In practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith\nlike the insistent \"whying\" of a 3 year old.  It isn't just that we would like\nto know what we do not know but that we feel we *must* know what we cannot\nknow.  The one produces frustration because curiosity is denied; the other\nleads to genuine anguish.  More specifically the poorer our understanding is in\ncoming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after\ncoming to faith.  If we do not know why we trust God, then we will always need\nto know exactly what God is doing in order to trust him.  Failing to grasp\nthat, we may not be able to trust him, for anything we do not understand may\ncount decisevely against what we are able to trust.  \n\nIf, on the other hand, we do know why we trust God, we will be able to trust\nhim in situations where we do not understand what He is doing. (Too many Xian\nleaders teach as if the Christian had a window in the back of his head which\nallows for understanding at every foot fall)  For what God is doing may be\nambiguous, but it will not be inherently contradictory!  It may be mystery to\nus, but mystery is only inscrutable; what would be insufferable is absurdity.\nAnd that my friend, was the conclusion of Nietzche both in theory and in\npractice.

For the first 6 months, the women each day ate\n8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second \n6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the    \nwomen each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection \nwere significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.   \n  The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.  \nIt is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The   \nresearchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some    \nbrands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus         \nthermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used  \nin commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a         \nprotective effect against Candida albicans, however. Women who want to  \ntry yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists     \nacidophilus in its contents.                                            \n--- end ---\n              \n\n                              \n===================================\n\nInfoTrac - Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92\n  THE MATERIAL CONTAINED IN Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92 IS PROVIDED\n  ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS\n  MEDICAL ADVICE OR INSTRUCTION.

In some circumstances, though, the    \norganisms proliferate, producing symptomatic infection of the mouth,    \nintestines, vagina, or skin.

The better ones also include\nadvice on exercises, posture and workstation setup.  Some use sound hardware to\n \nwarn of a break, others use beeps or screen messages.\n\nOften, RSI appears only after many years of typing, and the pain has\na delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typing\nall day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening.\nThese tools act as an early warning system: by listening to their\nwarnings and taking breaks with exercises, you don't have to wait for your \nbody to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is, getting RSI.\n\n \n    Tool: At Your Service (commercial software)\n    Available from:\n\tBright Star\n\tTel: +1 (206) 451 3697\n    Platforms: Mac (System 6.0.4), Windows\n    Description:\n\tProvides calendar, keyboard watch, email watch, and system info. \n\tWarns when to take a break (configurable).

Other information\n\ton non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer.\n\tA full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included.\n\n\tCHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not then\n\twarn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear\n\tuseful when used with Windows.\n\n\tCost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses.\n\n    Comments:\n\tThe keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better\n\tto measure the activity that is causing you problems than to\n\tmeasure clock time or even typing time.

Free demo ($5 outside US).\n \n    Comments:\n\tI have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: I would say\n\tit is better for RSI prevention than RSI management, because it\n\tdoes not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also, it\n\tinterrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which\n\tis not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK on\n\tWindows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure\n\twhy. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and has\n\tone window without window controls.

It does not provide exercises, but it does check\n\tthat you really do take a break, and tells you when you\n\tcan start typing again.  \n\n\tTypewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing\n\ttoday, each time it warns you, which is useful so you\n\tknow how much you *really* type.  It also logs information\n\tto a file that you can analyse or simply print out.  \n\n\tThe warning message appears on your screen (in character mode),\n\tin a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message\n\t(for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu> \n\thas put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for \n\tX, Zephyr and Mach.\n\n\tNot formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk\n\t(for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach,\n\tX Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give \n\tfeedback.\n\n    Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs\n    Available from:\n\tVarious sources\n    Platforms: Various\n    Description:\n\tAny calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming\n\tappointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool.\n\tOr, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit\n\ta program to run at a specific time to display a message to\n\tthe screen.\n\n\tUsing Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, and\n\tinclude this filename in your WIN.INI's 'load=' line so\n\tyou get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you\n\twant to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am.\n\tPress F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter\n\t9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break\n\tis for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat \n\tfor the next appointment.\n\n\tBy using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes\n\tthat set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this\n\tfile on your 'run=' line, as above, and you will then, with\n\ta single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments\n\twith RSI exercises.\n\n\tThe above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs. \n\tAn example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job\n\tthat runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will\n\tdepend a lot on your operating system.\n\n\tWhile these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing \n\tyourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI \n\tmanagement tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to\n\twrite a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating\n\tsystem, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.\n\n    Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers\n    Available from:\n\tVarious sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.\n    Description:\n\tMany digital watches have timers that count down from a settable\n\tnumber of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either\n\tmanually or automatically.  \n\n\tWhile these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you\n\tare writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from\n\ta computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great\n\tadvantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you\n\tare doing.\n\t\n    Comments:\n\tMy own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to\n\tmy writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which\n\tactually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left\n\tarm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been\n\tvery useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.\n\n\tI have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but\n\tthese are not much good because they do not give an audible\n\twarning of the end of the time period!\n\n\nKEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping\nso you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.  \nOne-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how \nyou use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you\nare simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing,\nand may therefore make matters worse.\n\n    Tool: hsh (public domain)\n    Available from:\n\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar\n    Platforms: UNIX (don't know which ones)\n    Description:\n\tAllows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings.\n\tOnly works through tty's (so, you can use it with a terminal or\n\tan xterm, but not most X programs).\n\n    Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various)\n    Available from:\n\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c\n\tAlso built into Windows 3.x. \n    Description:\n\tThe Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout\n\tthat involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help prevent\n\tRSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since \n\tit will slow down your typing a *lot* :-)  \n", "label": 13}

I can't say if you actually HATE\n    these leaders, but the lies and misrepresentations of them do\n    suggest that you have a visceral prejudice against them.\n    \n    So, while you claim that you do not hate anybody, there is an\n    ample body of evidence to suggest that this claim of yours is \n    false.  It is obvious that you hate Israel, and it is evident\n    that you hate the Jewish people.\n\n    And, if you are Jewish, you are a self-hating Jew.  There can\n    be no doubt of this.  Although you will call upon your Jewish\n    background in an effort to claim the high moral ground, there\n    is no doubt that you would like to see the Jewish people fade\n    away completely, as a people.  Your advocacy of intermarriage\n    for the purpose of dissolving the Jewish people is proof that \n    you hate the Jewish people.\n\n    And by your effort to superimpose the meaninglessness of your\n    own Jewishness on all Jews, you've clearly demonstrated to me \n    that you hate yourself.\n                      \n                      *       *       *       *\n\n    \"Who is a Jew?

{"text": "\n\nDo you count yourself as one who is weak in the faith?\n\n\nIs there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is missing\nthe mark?\n\n\nAre they clear or do you have doubts?\n\n\nAn important first step; the realization that Paul was human.\n\n\nYes, and he was writing and speaking for an audience that was at best,\nvery weak in the faith; most could not read, most were unfamiliar with\nthe Hebrew Scriptures in even the Septuagint form. Paul adapted the\nmessage of the Bible to a largely uneducated market. Granted, this\nmarket still exists today, but do you count yourself as part of it? To\nbe \"weak in the faith\" is not missing the mark (hamartia) if you do the\nbest that your education allows. Are you doing the best?\n\n\nLet me make clear that the \"Law\" is none other than the Pentateuch of\nGenesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. What did Jesus say\nabout the \"Law\" in Matt5:14-19? Where did Jesus say that the \"Law\" only\napplies to Jews and that Gentiles are above the \"Law\"?\n\n\nWho acknowledged this fact? On what basis? Are we extra-biblical at this\npoint? Why not also acknowledge that the Bhagavad-Gita is the only\nrelevant text for Gentiles, after all we see in the Bible that it was\nMagus from the east who observed the star-signs of Jesus? Why bother\nwith any texts at all? Why not just follow whatever the Church has to\nsay?\n\n\nI don't see how you can say this with a straight face. Are you a\nfollower of Christ, or do you follow someone else? Are you saying that\nthe words of Jesus only apply to Jews?\n\n\nHow Jewish was Paul after he changed his name from Saul?\n\n\nWho says Gentile Christians are not covered by the first five books? Who\nsays that Gentile Christians are above the Ten Commandments?\n\n\nYou're implying that Jesus' words are valid only for Jews. Is this\nreally what you mean to say? You do realize that you are gutting rather\nlarge portions of the Bible? When you read Jesus' words, did you ever\nconsider that maybe, just maybe Jesus is talking to you, no matter what\nyour race or sex? If the Hebrew Scriptures and the Gospel accounts of\nJesus are only directed to Jews, why were they translated into English?\n\n\nAs Paul would call him, one who was weak in the faith.\n\n\nWhich is more important: 1) The recorded word of Jesus or 2) Indications\nthat you can deduce from the Bible? Was Jesus God only of the Jews, or\nGod of all humankind of all race and sex?\n\n\nThis is your understanding of Paul. Compare this to the word of Jesus.\nAre you Christian or Pauline?\n\n\nAgain, this is your understanding of Paul. Did Jesus say that the Law\nwas an \"impossible standard?\" Did Jesus say that He superceded the Law?\nAre you Christian or Pauline?\n\n\nYou acknowledge that it is *your* reading of Paul. What did Jesus say?\nCan you deny that Matt5:14-19 is quite clear in its meaning? Are you \nChristian or Pauline?\n\n\nWhen did Jesus say that the purpose of the Law was conviction of sin?\n\n\nPlease reread Matt5:14-19. Are you Christian or Pauline?\n\n\nAre you saying that the Ten Commandments are ceremonial details?\n\n\nYou call observance of the Sabbath, the day on which the Lord rested,\nceremonial? Has circumcision been superceded for Christians?\n\n....\n\nAre you Christian or Pauline?\n\n[Both.  There is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is\nnot, at least not in this case.  Jesus did not deal explicitly with\nthe question of whether the Law was binding on Gentiles.  That's why I\nhave to cite evidence such as the way Jesus dealt with the Centurion.\n\nAs to general Jewish views on this, I am dependent largely on studies\nof Pauline theology, one by H.J. Schoeps, and one whose author I can't\ncome up with at the moment.  Both authors are Jews.  Also, various\nChristian and non-Christian Jews have discussed the issue here and in\nother newsgroups.\n\nMat 5:19 is clear that the Law is still valid.  It does not say that\nit applies to Gentiles.\n\nAnd yes, I say that the specific requirement for worship on the\nSabbath in the Ten Commandments is a ceremonial detail, when you're\nlooking at the obligations of Gentiles.  Similarly circumcision.\n\nI'm not sure quite what else I can say on this subject.  Again, it's\nunfortunate the Jesus didn't answer the question directly.  However we\ndo know (1) what the 1st Cent. Jewish approach was, (2) how Jesus\ndealt with at least one Gentile, and (3) how Jesus' disciples dealt\nwith the issue when it became more acute (I'm referring to Acts 15\nmore than Paul).

Also, as was observed at\n: the very top of this post, Mary had to be free from sin in order to be the\n: mother of Jesus, who was definitely without sin.\n\nIf the mother of Jesus had to be without sin in order to give\nbirth to God, then why didn't Mary's mother have to be without\nsin in order to give birth to the perfect vessel for Jesus?  For\nthat matter, why didn't Mary's grandmother have to be without sin\neither?  Seems to me that with all the original sin flowing\nthrough each person, the need for the last one (Mary) to have\nnone puts God in a box, where we say that He couldn't have\nincarnated Himself through a normal human being.\n\nMy God is an all powerful God, Who can do whatever suits His\npurpose.  This includes creating a solar system and planet earth\nwith the appearance of great age; providing a path through the\nRed Sea for the children of Israel that does not depend on the\nexistence of a ridge of high ground and a wind blowing at the\nright speed and direction; and the birth of Himself from a normal\nsinful person without being tainted by her original sin.\n\nI see far too much focus on the \"objects\" of religion and not\nnearly enough on the personal relationship that is available to\nall believers with the Author of our existence, without the\nnecessity of having this relationship channeled through conduits\nto God in the form of Mary, Apostles and a Pope.\n\n: Note that the idea of Mary being conceived without Original Sin, i.e. the\n: Immaculate Conception, is distinct from the idea of Mary not having sinned\n: during her lifetime, which is a separate doctrine and, I believe, also\n: held by the Catholic Church.\n\nIf Mary was born without original sin, and didn't sin during her\nlifetime, how is she any different from Jesus?

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\n \n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\nthe Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\nto handle your account.\n \n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\na 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year,\nbut cancel you after that.\"\n \n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.\"\n \n That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\n \nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\ntheft.\n \n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\| |\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone's entitled to MY opinion.\n  / | |/ ||\\|\\  \\_|\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\n \n \n \n \n \n======================================================================== 32\n \nI live in Idaho.

For private\nownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must\nbe able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe\ncondition. If any random private citizen could not properly\nkeep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation\nis clearly appropriate.\n\n\n\nI disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend\nthemselves and their community. If you look at the American \nrevolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves\nfrom, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They\ndidn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for \nexample) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same\nold regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and\ndestroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate.\nBut their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited\nfor that.\n\nThere is also the question of personal and collective arms: The\nSecond Amendment definately protects ownership of personal\nweapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members\nto provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers\nother arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example)\na tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively)\nshould. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a \ndisproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower.\nThe militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely\ndemocratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only\n50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would\nbe proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular\nwill were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the\nmembers supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the\nform of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's\nfirepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not\nof the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite\ndifferent from the general public (at the very least, they\nwould be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and\ncharacter of the militia requires that each member provide\na roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personal\nweapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.", "label": 16}

{"text": "\nLarry -\n\nThanks for the reply, but this isn't quite the same thing.  Like I said before, \nI can understand why non-Christians would be denied *access* to holy \nceremonies, but the ceremony itself (communion) was not secret.  In fact, all \nfour gospels record the first \"breaking of the bread\" in some detail.  \nCommunion was a fellowship meal, and it was (and still should be, in my \nopinion) inappropriate to invite those who did not share in the fellowship of \nthe Body of Christ.  The fact that unbelievers, denied access to these communal \nmeals, began to imagine all sorts of secret and debased rituals during \ncommunion does not by any means imply that the early Christians were in fact \nhiding shameful things from the general public.  In fact, I think if you read \nsome of the early church fathers, you will find that they were not at all \nbashful about describing what went on during communion.  That's why it seems \nfunny to me when Mormons, who claim to be the only true restoration of 1st \ncentury Christianity, insist on hiding certain rituals on the grounds that they \nare \"too sacred.\"\n\n- Mark", "label": 15}

(Much thanks to Jayne K who is\nalready supporting me with kind words and prayers!)\n\nI've been working at this company for eight years in various\nengineering jobs.  I'm female.  Yesterday I counted and realized that\non seven different occasions I've been sexually harrassed at this\ncompany.  Seven times. Eight years. Yesterday was the most recent one;\nsomeone left an X-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer.\n\nI'm really upset by this.  I suppose it could have been worse -- it\ncould have been a man having sex with a sheep or something.\n\nThere was no note.  I do not know if it was:\n\n\t- someone's idea of an innocent joke, that went awry\n\t- someone's sick idea of flirting\n\t- an act of emotional terrorism (that worked!)\n\nI dreaded coming back to work today.  What if my boss comes in to ask\nme some kind of question, I don't know the answer so I take a military\nspecification down off from my shelf to look up the answer, and out\nfalls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep?  I generally have a\nBible on my desk for occasional inspiration; what if I open it up to\nCorinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy Love\nAssociation?  I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff.\n\nI can lock up my desk, but I can't lock up every book I have in the\noffice.  I can't trust that someone won't shove something into my\nbriefcase or my coat pocket when I'm not looking so that I go home to\nfind such a picture, or a threat, or a raunchy note about what someone\nwants to do to my body.\n\nTo make it worse, the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to\ntreat our marvelous secretary to lunch.  The appointed hour for\nleaving was 11:30.  I was working in another building but wanted to go\nto the lunch.  So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single\nperson had already left for lunch.  They left at 11:15 or so.  No one\ncould be bothered to call me at the other building, even though my\nnumber was posted.  So, I came back to a department that looked like a\nneutron bomb had gone off and I was the sole survivor.  This, despite\nthe fact that everyone knew how bad I felt about this naked woman being\nleft in my desk drawer.\n\nI need some prayers --- I can't stop crying. I am so deeply wounded\nthat it's ridiculous.\n\nI feel like I'm some kind of sub-human piece of garbage for people to\nreduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act.  I feel\nlike I'm a sub-human piece of garbage that's not worthy of a simple\nphone call saying \"We're leaving for Mary's lunch a little early so\nthat Bob can get back for a big 1:00 meeting...\"\n\nPlease pray that my resentments will either go away, or be miraculously\nturned into something positive.  Please pray that whoever is torturing\nme so will stop, and find some healing for him- or herself. Please pray\nfor my being healed from this latest wound (which falls on top of a\nwhole slew of other wounds...).  Please pray that I can find a new job\nin a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such\nharrassment from happening in the first place, and swiftly acts\nappropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions. (This\ncompany, in my opinion, has pretty words about how sexual harrassment\nisn't tolerated but when you get right down to it, how is it that one\nfemale engineer can be touched inappropriately, left obsene or\nthreatening notes, left obscene pictures, spoken to lewdly, etc, seven\ntimes in eight years in the same place?  Pretty words from the company\ndo me no good when I'm terrified or healing from the latest assault.)\n\nAnd please pray that I don't turn into an automaton because of this.\nThat's my bad habit: \"ignore it and it will go away\", \"you're not worth\nanyone's time so don't go talking to anyone about this\", \"you're right,\nyou are a sub-human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this\nway\", \"you are just an object\", \"you prostitute your mind to this\ncompany so why can't others expect you to prostitute your body there as\nwell?\", \"what makes you think women aren't just possessions, and\nnothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act?\"\nThis is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major\ndepressive episode; please pray that these thoughts don't come into\nmy head and stay there, triggering depression.\n\nPlease pray that this latest trauma doesn't come between me and God.\nIn a way, a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to\nGod, and it's also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can\nseparate one mentally from God.  (I know God doesn't drop me from his\nloving hand, but it's awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the\nhand, look down, think I'm falling and forget that God's still holding\non to me.)\n\nAlthough this probably isn't entirely appropriate for this newsgroup,\nI really can use the kind of loving support you all provide.  For this\nreason I hope good Mr. Moderator allows me this latest indulgence.  After\nall, he's allowed me the thermometer note, and a few other off-the-wall\ntopics.\n\nThanks in advance to everyone for your support and prayers.  Peace to you,\nEsther\n", "label": 15}

The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \nevery 21 days.\n\n\nContents:\n\n* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?\n* What are the US export regulations?\n* What is TEMPEST?\n* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?\n* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?\n* Is RSA patented?\n* What about the Voynich manuscript?\n\n\n* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?\n\n  The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It\n  was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40's, and\n  has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is\n  known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,\n  and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the\n  world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of\n  cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many\n  years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break\n  many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national\n  security almost all information about the NSA is classified.\n\n  Bamford's book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of\n  the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the\n  difference between public and private research in cryptography:\n\n  ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,\n  one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted\n  behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged\n  today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of\n  those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10\n  years has there in fact been widespread open research in\n  cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts\n  between these two research communities. Open research is common\n  quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open\n  exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in\n  scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with\n  responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,\n  countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can\n  a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might\n  undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?\n  One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would\n  force all governments to behave like Stimson's `gentlemen', but one\n  must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with\n  political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most\n  scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have\n  occurred between government agencies and open researchers in\n  cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which\n  we are aware) have been so few and so mild.''\n\n* What are the US export regulations?\n\n  In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control\n  export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export\n  Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by\n  the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office\n  of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized\n  by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule\n  of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent\n  requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see\n  everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.\n\n  The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting\n  discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what\n  people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which\n  go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to\n  consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in\n  jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at\n  least heard of the ITAR.\n\n* What is TEMPEST?\n\n  TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer\n  equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that\n  information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at\n  quite a distance and with little effort.\n\n  Needless to say, encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext\n  is available this way.\n\n* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?\n\n  (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for\n  corrections.)\n\n  The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas\n  Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass\n  of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving\n  three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the\n  location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.\n  Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;\n  it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the\n  Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;\n  many documents have been tried as the key to B1.\n\n  Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various\n  means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:\n\n  The Beale Cypher Association\n  P.O. Box 975\n  Beaver Falls, PA 15010\n\n  You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the\n  line:\n\n  send index\n\n  in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.\n  (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher\n  floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,\n  says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)\n\n  Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of\n  problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI\n  and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.\n  Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this\n  string couldn't appear by chance, but feels there must be an\n  explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this\n  string.\n\n* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?\n\n  The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis\n  on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with\n  pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram'' includes\n  articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in\n  English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,\n  Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.\n\n  Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;\n  less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent\n  to ACA Treasurer, 18789 West Hickory St., Mundelein, IL 60060.\n\n* Is RSA patented?\n\n  Yes. The patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12/14/77, granted 9/20/83.\n  For further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been\n  granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral\n  issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information\n  about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of\n  the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as\n  ``should RSA be patented?'', which often flooded sci.crypt and other\n  technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum.\n\n* What about the Voynich manuscript?\n\n  nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the\n  subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list\n  is: <voynich-request@rand.org>\n\n  the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich", "label": 11}

Besides,\nthe ranch house (not \"fort apocalypse\"; it was just a house despite what\nthe FBI and ATF says) was on *fire*.  The \"Gun loonies\" couldn't hardly\nhave been shooting at fire men while there house was engulfed in flames.\nThe FBI and ATF don't have any excuse for not having fire engines there\nto put out the blaze.  The bastards waited until the fire was *well*\nunder way before they called the fire department in Waco.  They didn't\neven tell the fire department to be on standby.  I sincerely hope that\nthe FBI, ATF, Attorney General Janet Reno, and all others involved in\nthis fiasco get the just punishment that they so richly deserve.\nSomeone should pay for this needless, tragic waste of human life.\n\nSadly, these evil SOBs will probably never face justice.  The media\nand the government will just whitewash this incident and chalk it\nup as being solely David Koresh's fault.  Sadder still, the American\npeople will probably believe them.\n\n\nThis is not the problem...the problem is that we have a government that\nis becoming more tyrannical every day.  If people decide to own guns\n*and* live in one place together then that is their prerogative.  On\nthe other hand, if the BDs were in posession of explosives and illegal\nguns then the government did have the right to search their compound.\nBut, the allegations that the BDs were in posession of illegal weapons\nhasn't been proven yet, so I'm not going to conclude that the BDs broke\nany laws.  David Koresh was accused of abusing children, but if this\nis his *only* crime then the presence of the ATF can't be justified.\nThe ATF is only supposed to deal with firearms, tobacco, and alcohol\nviolations.  ATF agents are basically cigarette cops...they should\nstay out of other kinds of law-enforcement actions that are out of\ntheir jurisdiction.  Better yet, they should be s**tcanned IMO.\n\n\nSounds like something the SS would do.  Human life---children and adults\nalike---should be treated with respect---even if they are \"heavily-armed\nreligious wackos\".\n\nDavid Koresh's lawyer seemed to think that everyone *would* come out\npeacefully sooner or later.  The FBI and ATF had NOTHING BUT TIME ON\nTHEIR HANDS!  Why did they have to escalate the situation and cause\nthis senseless tragedy?  Their job is to protect the public and SAVE\nLIVES NOT KILL PEOPLE for crying out loud.\n\n \nDon't be so sure about that.  I read in a newspaper today that one of the\ncult members said that when one of the tanks went through the wall that\nit knocked over a lantern which caused the ranch house to be caught on\nfire.  This cult member also said that David Koresh had *no* intentions\nof committing mass suicide.  David Koresh's lawyer also confirms this.\nTherefore, if this is true then this means that the FBI AND ATF MURDERED\nEVERYONE IN THAT HOUSE!  Even if this is not true, the FBI and ATF still\ndon't get off the hook because they waited a damn long time to call the\nWaco fire department.  Perhaps they wanted all these people to die.\n\n \nYou're wrong on several accounts.  ATF agents were adequately armed.  They\nhad MP5s, AR-15s, and shotguns.  Some agents were armed with automatic\npistols but not all were.  The ATF's initial claim---which they later\nretracted---that agents were underarmed is simply ludicrous.\n\n\nGun control isn't the only issue here.  If the sick little monkeys in\nWashington try to use the Waco incident as a reason to ban guns then\nthey will have demonstrated just how f***ed up they are.

{"text": "\nRadius speculated, publicly, that they could provide a PowerPC-based\nRocket for existing Macs. It would have the plus of RocketShare and\nthe minus of NuBus accelerators - no true boot off the accelerator,\nNuBus bottleneck to video and other I/O.\n\nApple, it seems, will not compete with third parties here -- except\nperhaps for not-yet-available Macs like Cyclone, where a PowerPC\nslot might be advertised. Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPC\naccelerators.\n\nOne potential problem with any accelerator, though, is that it will\nneed a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius, with\nRocketshare, to use any of its proprietary code.\n\nApple is, between the lines, trying to let us know that PowerPC Macs\nwill have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISC\nand that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in\nexisting 68040 Macs. Perhaps, then, we'll see groundbreaking\nprices in Mac-logic board upgrades, much the same way we've seen\nmuch cheaper high-performance CPUs this year.\n\nFirst generation PowerPCs, 98601s, will also hopefully have socketed\nCPUs so that they'll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later.\nThis should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulled\nfor clock doublers. If there is too much technical   baggage (which\nI doubt since the external busses are the same size/width) to do\nthis, perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard, a la Powerbook, as\nstandard to facilitate better CPU upgrades. This is an area where\nApple has fallen far behing the Intel-based world. Perhaps catchup\nis in order.\n\nBy the way, last week's PC week had an excellent story on PowerPC,\nPentium, MIPS R4000, DEC Alpha (the big four on the microprocessor\nfront for the forseeable future). Worth reading for technojunkies.\nAlso, the latest PC has a cover story on Pentium. Read it, and all\nthe other stories about how Intel is unstoppable and preeminent\nright now.\n\nOnce anyone is this secure, they are due to fall. Intel's market\nposition will never again be as dominant as it is today (especially\nif AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears it\nmight). The competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesome\nbattle. Apple users should be excited that PowerPC, while not\nguaranteed dominance, is a guaranteed winner, even if its one of\nseveral.", "label": 4}

{"text": "This reminds me of the last Graham Kerr cooking show I saw.  Today he\nsmoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange technique\nI'd never seen before.\n\nHe took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil.\nThe tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray,\nmade by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.\n\nIn the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar\nquantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two\nteabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.\n\nOn top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with\ntwo chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly\nwent on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.\n\nLater, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises\nand concerns me are:\n\n1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?\n\n2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color\n    (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring\n    agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected\n    it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,\n    caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being\n    used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?\n\n3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated\n    as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract\n    from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever\n    happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea\n    could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do\n    so.\n\nWRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens),\nI've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy\ntaste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently\nstopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips,\ngetting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process,\nthen slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.\n\nMy theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight\nstuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort\nof larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after\nthe initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff,\njust leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?\n\nI also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping\non the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because\nit covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill\nnon-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this\nduck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals\nat one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the\nfloor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire\nin that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.\n\nAnd yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that\nsmoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains\nnitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually\nhas some standing, don't know about the others.", "label": 13}

Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific \ncommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and \nJanuary 1994.\n\n\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES\nThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the \nUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\n\n\nPROGRAM DESIGN\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\n\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\nrelatively short time.\n\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\n\n\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\nand participate in the management of technology.

{"text": "As promised, I spoke today with the company mentioned in a Washington\nTimes article about the Clipper chip announcement. The name of the company\nis Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end\nof this message on how to contact them).\n\n   Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that\nwe are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications\nbrought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.\n\n   His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the\nrest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:\n\n - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use\n   the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.\n\n - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T's secure telephone\n   devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.\n   This stuck them as strange, until now...\n\n\n   Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several\nconcerns over the new Clipper Chip:\n\n  - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.\n\n  - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto\n    system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency\n    of the government.\n\n  - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm\n    is vulnerable over time to an attacker.\n\n  - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that\n    it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or\n    changing the keys themselves.\n\n  - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and\n    money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed\n    engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very\n    difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique\n    to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is\n    hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.\n\nAdditonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tell\nme much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet.\nHowever he told me a little:\n\n - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been\n   granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is\n   secure.\n\n - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.\n   The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret\n   until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate\n   the following:\n\n    - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but\n      Mr. Melnick stated \"Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.\")\n\n    - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.\n\n    - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).\n\n    - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that\n      it is _adujustable_ and is \"More than adequate for security.\"\n\n    - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and\n      can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which\n      is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I\n      consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.\n\n    - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques\n      such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the\n      hardware chip.\n\n    - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars\n      for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced\n      enough, which probably won't happen]).\n\n    - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm\n      and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted\n      data into \"blocks.\" This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know\n      what the block header is. This program operates at all supported\n      RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.\n\n    - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!\n\n\n\nRight now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out\nof business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in\nstopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard.

{"text": "Reading from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet, their\nERL-1906 resin with T40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive\nstrength of 280,000 psi.  It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in,\ntherefore the theoretical height for a constant section column\nthat can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft,\nor 75 Statute miles.\n\nNow, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss\ntype, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.\nLet us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical \nstrength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant\nsection column.  \n\nA constant section column is not the limit on how high you can\nbuild something if you allow a tapering of the cross section\nas you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound\nload to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in\ncalculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross\nsectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure\nbelow the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile \nbelow the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.\n\nThe next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section\nto support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile\nof structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way\nto the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical\nlimit on area, although there will be practical limits based\non how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how\nmuch load you need to support on the ground (for which you need\na foundation that the bedrock can support.\n\nLet us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction\ncost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites,\nassuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure\nis just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass\nratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower\nheight becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant\natmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still\nhave to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses\nwill be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of\nrocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,\nbut which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus\nthey represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting\nfrom the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.\n\nThis analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind\nloads.  These will require more structural support over the first\n15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low\nenough value for it not to be a big factor.\n\nDani Eder\n", "label": 14}

{"text": "   I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 Ninja.\n   This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride\n   (read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty, \n   fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).\n\nCommunication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler\nback every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffled\nMagna, we can hear each other.  It's only above, say, 45 MPH that you \ncan't really communicate.\n\nBalance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know how\nthey're going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately\nand lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning\nthing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a\npain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay\nperpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn\nand WHIP AROUND until they're in the `correct' position.  This always\nscrews up the line I've picked out.\n\nHere's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:\n\t- attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.\n\t- Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not\n\t  get on/off unless I say you can.  (I've had people try to dismount\n\t  in traffic, just as I'm pulling in to a parking space!)\n\t- Muffler gets HOT! ('Nuff said)\n\t- We get *GOOD* traction.  We're not going to fall over.  (Many\n\t  first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)\n\t- Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you're sitting upright and\n\t  we're going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you're\n\t  confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel\n\t  of it.  Or just hug me tight.  \n\t- Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be \n\t  gradual, so I can compensate.\n\t- Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.\n\t- Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right \n\t  thing -- I've driven many miles on this thing, and know how\n\t  to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to\n\t  stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to \n\t  watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84, \n\t  and whever we topped 35 mph, she'd holler, \"SLOW DOWN! I'M SCARED\" \n\t  I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with \n\t  the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.\n\t  Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the\n\t  instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her\n\t  experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to \n\t  trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)\n\nUsually I'll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes, \ntires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers.\nHelps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.\n\nWatch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of little\nmudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will\nbe nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones.\nIt doesn't help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the \nfirst trip!\n\nGood luck -- have fun!", "label": 8}

My voice is coming to\nyou this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio\nstation in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to\nmeet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,\nhealth care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly\nbroadcast with the American people. \n             \n             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when\nit reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past\nseven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with\nthe people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus\ntour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last\nyear's campaign.\n             \n             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with\nyou, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and\nwhat I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting\nto you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.\n             \n             You sent me to Washington to get our government and\neconomy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad\nexperiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important\nit is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do\nbusiness.  \n             \n             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations\nrise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness\nof their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the\ncooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,\nlabor and government.  Although many of the economies of the\nindustrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've\nmade many of the smart investments and the tough choices which\nour government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them\nhave been moving ahead and too many of our people have been\nfalling behind.\n             \n             We have an economy today that even when it grows is\nnot producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation\nby four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to\nshow for it.  We know that wages of most working people have\nstopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks\nand that too many families can no longer afford the escalating\ncost of health care.\n             \n             But we also know that, given the right tools, the\nright incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and\nbusinesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy\nneeds to expand opportunity and to make our communities better\nplaces to live.\n             \n             In many critical products today Americans are the\nlow cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that\nwe create more of those kinds of jobs.\n             \n             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for\nlong-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old\npriorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to\nbe -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs\nand education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the\nwaste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious\nresources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the\ngroundwork for robust economic growth in the future.\n             \n             These new directions passed the Congress in record\ntime and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our\ncountry.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would\ncreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private\nsector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It\nnow has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. \nBut it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the\nSenate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know\nwould result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.\n             \n             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. \nMillions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and\ncounting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill\nhas been grounded by gridlock.  \n             \n             I know the American people are tired of business as\nusual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin\nor wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have\ntaken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra\nmile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25\npercent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  \n             \n             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million\nAmericans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill\nlanguish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean\nhundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to\nact to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking\nthis initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I\nthink we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant\nportion of our original goals.\n             \n             First, we want to keep the programs as much as\npossible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,\nincluding highway and road construction, summer jobs for young\npeople, immunization for children, construction of waste water\nsites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding\nfor extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who\nhave been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't\ncreating jobs.\n             \n             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs\nin the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40\npercent.\n             \n             And third, I've recommended a new element in this\nprogram to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against\ncrime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire\npolice officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put\nthem back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight\nfor a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it\nand deserve it.\n             \n             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --\nthe Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it\nincreases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this\nyear that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,\ndoesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more\nthan paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this\nbudget is well within the spending limits already approved by the\nCongress this year.\n             \n             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators\nwho are filibustering the bill voted during the previous\nadministration for billions of dollars of the same kind of\nemergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the\nAmerican people to work.  \n             \n             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered\na plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities\nare -- on people or on politics.  \n             \n             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar\nfor dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the\nsoundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our\nchildren.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs\nand investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of\nus when we've helped make more American partners working to\nensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.\n             \n             You know, if every American who wanted a job had\none, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this\ncountry today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first\nstep to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country\nagain.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid\nfor over the life of our budget.\n             \n             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how\nimportant the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.\n             \n             Good morning, and thank you for listening.", "label": 18}

{"text": "There have been a number of articles on the PBS frontline program\nabout Iranian bomb. Here is my $0.02 on this and related subjects.\n\nOne is curious to know the real reasons behind this and related\npublic relations campaign about Iran in recent months. These include:\n\n1) Attempts to implicate Iran in the bombing of the New York Trade\n   Center. Despite great efforts in this direction they have not\n   succeeded in this. They, however, have indirectly created\n   the impression that Iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist\n   Islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter.\n\n2) Public statements by the Secretary of State Christoffer and\n   other official sources regarding Iran being a terrorist and\n   outlaw state.\n\n3) And finally the recent broadcast of the Frontline program. I \n   suspect that this PR campaign against Iran will continue and\n   perhaps intensify.\n\nWhy this increased pressure on Iran? A number of factors may have\nbeen behind this. These include:\n\n1) The rise of Islamic movements in North-Africa and radical\n   Hamas movement in the Israeli occupied territories. This\n   movement is basically anti-western and is not necessarily\n   fueled by Iran. The cause for accelerated pace of this \n   movement is probably the Gulf War which sought to return\n   colonial Shieks and Amirs to their throne in the name of\n   democracy and freedom. Also, the obvious support of Algerian\n   military coup against the democratically elected Algerian\n   Islamic Front which clearly exposed the democracy myth.\n   A further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news\n   on the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems.\n\n2) Possible future implications of this movement in Saudi Arabia\n   and other US client states and endangerment of the cheap oil\n   sources from this region.\n\n3) A need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense\n   expenditures. This has become necessary after the demise of\n   Soveit Union.\n\nThe recent PR campaign against Iran, however, seems to be directed\nfrom Israel rather than Washington. There is no fundamental conflict\nof interest between Iran and the US and in my opinion, it is in the\ninterest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal\nand friendly relations.

{"text": "\nRather, people kill people with guns.  The sad truth is: sometimes that is\ngood, or at least, better than the alternative.\n\n\nOk.  There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1], and the\nnumber has been in decline since early this century [2].  Most of these\naccidents involve rifles or shot guns, not handguns.\n\n...\n\nIn fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that. \nThe idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber\nhandgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense,\nwould, I'm sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  It certainly isn't\nwhy I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it,\nand might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to\nkill people.\n\n\nIn fact, that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive uses\nof firearms don't involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefer\nnot to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what\nyou say when you point a gun at them.\n\nIf you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to\nimmediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  A handgun is\nabout the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work\nthe best.[3]\n\n\nCertainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing)\naren't deadly weapons.  However, it simply isn't true to say that all of\nthem were designed to kill people.  Moreover, what exactly is wrong with\nhaving deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to\nuse deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right,\nbut my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and\nknowing how to use the tools to do that.\n\n\"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear\narms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in\ngovernment.\"\n\t- T. Jefferson.\n\nI think what Jefferson said is still true.\n\n\nNot very often compared to other use.[3]\n\n\nThis isn't that common either, at least when compared to other uses.  It is\nvery rare that a non-violent person will suddenly \"get-pissed\" and kill\nsomeone, gun or not.  In most cases, the people who murder have long\nhistories of violence.  If you have good reason to believe that these\npeople wouldn't kill if they didn't have a gun, feel free to present it.\n\n\nRight, but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope I\nnever have to shoot a person, but I've had to kill a number of animals from\nrodents to cows, and when I do, I don't want them to suffer any more than\nis necessary.  I prefer they die instantly, but failing that, I want them\nto drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that,\nI don't want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon and\nammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I'm\nafter, but it doesn't always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point,\npeople who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns,\nparticularly handguns, haven't used them much for that purpose.\n\n\n[1] Accidental deaths in 1988:\n\t48700 deaths by auto\n\t11300 deaths by fall\n\t 5300 deaths by drowning\n\t 4800 deaths by fire\n\t 4400 deaths by poison\n\t 3200 deaths by food\n\t 1400 deaths by firearm\n\n     Source: Statistics Department, National Safety Council.\n     \"Accidents Facts 1988 Edition\".

I saw, on CNN, at least\n    three different types.   I would be hard pressed to identify\n    a bunch of guys in 'bring-your-own' battle fatigues as\n    uniformed officers of the law even if they were claiming to\n    be police.\n    \n2)  The BATF has been lying from the beginning:\n    + \"We only had handguns\" - the original footage showed 4 BATF\n      officers on a roof top getting shot at,  one had an MP-5\n      assault sub-machine gun.\n    + \"We were out gunned\" - sub-machine guns and shotguns are the\n      BEST in quarters weapon,  you can't be out gunned when you\n      have the best guns available for the job.\n    + \"We didn't know they had guns that would shoot through doors!\" -\n      this one is the best,  there are very few guns that won't shoot\n      through a household door,  or through a house WALL for that\n      matter.  Since officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and\n      *Firearms* should know that,  they are either lying or incredibly\n      incompetent.  Not to mention criminally negligent if they are\n      shooting bullets that they think will stop when the encounter\n      plywood.\n    + \"We had a search warrant.  Actually, we had an arrest warrant.\n       No, wait,  we had both.  Yeah, that's the ticket.\n       Oh, and they're child molesters too.  And they make *drugs*.\n       Did we mention we think they have rocket launchers.\"\n      - The story from BATF and FBI spokespeople has changed daily\n      and their claims were getting increasingly outrageous.\n      \n3)  Throughout the siege the FBI and BATF have be claiming that one\n    of their biggest concerns was that Koresh and his followers would\n    mass suicide.   Now they are claiming that that's what he did\n    AND that they are surprised that he did.

{"text": "\n\nI beg to disagree with the assertion that science is a collection of models.\nScientific models are a game to play, and are only as good as the\nassumptions and measurements (if any) that go into them.\n\nAs an example, I remember when nuclear winter was the big hype in\natmospheric science.  It wasn't long after Sagan's admonitions that\none of our boys was adding another level of reality into his model of\nthe nuclear winter scenario at ERL in Boulder.  He decided to assume\nthat the atmosphere is more like a two-dimensional thing, than a one-\ndimensional thing.  He also assumed that it rained and that the winds\nblow in the real atmosphere.  On returning to Georgia Tech, he showed\na transparency of atmospheric cooling rates according to the year they\nwere generated by the models.  There was an unmistakable correlation\nbetween the age (meaning simplicity of assumptions; i.e., remoteness\nfrom reality) of each model and the degree of cooling.  Whereas Sagan's\nmodel showed an approximate 40-degree cooling episode, the next model \nin sophistication showed about half that, and so on until we got to\nour boy's model, which showed a 1-2 degree drop if the war happened in\nthe winter and less than a 10 degree drop if it happened in the summer.\nHe predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans, chemistry,\nthe biosphere, and other indicators of reality in the models, we would\nprobably see even less cooling.  Thus nuclear winter was reduced to even\nless than a nuclear autumn, one might say, to a nuclear fizzle.\n\nTo quote from H.S. Yoder,\n\n\tThe postulated models have become accepted as the reality\n\tinstead of the lattice of assumptions they are.\n\tAuthoritarianism dominates the field, and a very critical\n\tanalysis of each argument is to be encouraged.... Skepticism\n\tof the model approach to earth problems is warranted because\n\tmany key parameters have not been included.\n\nThis statement surely applies equally well to cosmogony.  Only when\nconvincing observational evidence substantiates the modeled results\nmay one suggest that the model may describe the reality.

We need this investment for \nsummer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the \nimportant programs that will put people back to work right away this \nsummer.

I think there's no \nquestion about that.  There's been some frustration of legislative \nactivity over the last few days.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So, you'll need to compromise to get your package \nthrough?\n\t     \n\t     MR.

And it's a budget which provides for \nimportant investments in our future.  Right now we've also had strong \npassage of his jobs program through the House.

The context of the \nconversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring \nPresident Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime \nMinister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's \nbelief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.  \nI mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and \netiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where \nhe was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese \nwere serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t   Are you saying that the President said that when \nthe Japanese say yes they mean no?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not -- I don't know the \nexact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say \nsomething along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime \nMinister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Have there been any attempts to explain this to the \nJapanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and \nthere appears to be --\n\t     \n\t     MR.

I don't think it's going to be a problem.  I believe that \nthere may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up \nbut I'm not positive.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, was the specific comment that was made \nspecific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general \nobservation on Japanese etiquette?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The specific comment is what I'm asking about that \nhas alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, \"when the \nJapanese say yes they mean no.\"\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean \nI don't think that's the whole sentence.  I think that the specific \ncomment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific \nfinish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that \nPrime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Was he saying it facetiously first?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual \nobservation.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to \nclear it up.  Has the President sent a message?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don't think the President \nspoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but \nI'm not sure exactly how many.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're \nmaking it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got \nthe reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that \nit was understood and make sure there was absolutely no \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the \nSecretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure \nthere is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don't believe there is \non.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is our position about the Japanese?  That they \nmay have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese \nis as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two \ndays.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime \nMinister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S. \nposition, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the \nKuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's \ncommitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a \nconstructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to \nhear that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq \nfor the last few days, I'm a little confused.  What is the U.S. \npolicy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the same policy that Secretary \nChristopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have \nreiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance \nwith all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     throwing it out further that if Iraq complies, \nSaddam can't stay in office?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that's -- our \njudgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with \nthe resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that \nwe expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will \ncontinue to demand it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And are you concerned the Iran will become the \ndominant power in the area --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also \nspoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect \nfull Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping \nsupport of terrorism.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in \npower if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you \nbase that?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not \ncomplying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the \nrights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is \nnot fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.  \nHe is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding \narmaments.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, when do you think that if he did comply he \nwould be out of power?\n\n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on \nthe repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make \nit more difficult for him to stay in power.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, back on the stimulus package, why is it \nthat you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure \npolitics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence \ndo you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical \ndifference with you that's in good faith?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times \nin the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the \nfight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now \nseek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, in regards to that, some of the moderate \nRepublicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to \nthem during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had \none, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate \nRepublicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and \nthinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some -\n-\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I'm not sure that it's true \nthat there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the \nRepublican leadership on at least two occasions before the \nintroduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate \nRepublican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are \ncontinually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who \nhave an interest in the President's package.  We are interested in \nwhat they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is \nimportant, and we're going to continue to fight for it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats \nalone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it \nthrough?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is \nno question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can \nfrustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.  \nYou only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going \nand to stop any action, and that's what the Republicans are doing.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     going to rethink the way you attempt to get \nother things passed as you go through this process for the rest of \nthe summer?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     work with Republicans and try to woo some \nRepublicans into your camp?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're going to continue to \nlook for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the \nPresident's intiatives?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But on this one -- how are you going to do it \ndifferently than you did it on this one because on this one you \nreally did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear \nthat it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and \ncould get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes?  \nAre you going to take a different tack when you have to go for \nparticular votes?  When you have to go through --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't see into the future and \nunderstand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the \nPresident's going to continue to reach out when he can.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You don't have any regrets then about the way you \nhave handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your \napproach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this \nexperience?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like \nhis package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue \nto press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans, \nthere's not question about that.  And we'll continue to reason with \nthem and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this \ncase the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around \na plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  They're being denied any other legislative means of \nputting their proposals forward.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they're being --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     any ideas.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being \ndefeated; I don't know that they're being denied.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     to present them.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not exactly true.  I mean \nthey get the votes --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     that theirs can be passed though by the \nparliamentary rules under which they're playing.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in \nsupport all the way around, no, that's not exactly true.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration \nbacking any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we're pressing for \nIraqi compliance.  I don't know if we can get into the business of \ngrooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at \nsome levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don't know  about \nanything recently.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the \nPresident's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be \nsome kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the \nPresident, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider \nsomething like that, or any other kind of intervention there?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President \nappointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a \nspecial envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around \nthe California economic situation, including the situation in Los \nAngeles.  \n\t     \n\t     I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles \nby the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary, \nMr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD \nSecretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits \nby Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I \nwouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to \nCalifornia.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is \nconcerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy \ndecisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities \nwhich help prevent disturbances.  But we're going to continue to \nwatch it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also \nsupposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a \ngroup of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball \nmanagement.  Does the President have a position on that?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received \ncorrespondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson \nhas also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.  \nHe clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in \nbaseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the \nPresident intends to continue to go to the ball game.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he going to say anything about it today, or see \nReverend Jackson while he's out there?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he is going to see \nthem, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has \nraised some serious questions, and it's something that, as I said, \neven though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball \ngame?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure about that.  I believe \nthe characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an \ninformational pickett.  I don't know that he asked him not to go to \nthe ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining \nhis concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the \nPresident read it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the \nmanaging partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be \nthere, and is he going to meet with the President?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is the Mubarak schedule?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is \ncoming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a \nlunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice \nPresident Gore.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And joint statements tomorrow --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end, \nyes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did \nwarn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist \nactivities?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times, \nI mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been \ngeneral conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a \nlong period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I \nmean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there \nwas no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.  \nThe President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also \nreiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians, \napparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who, \nforgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at \nthe moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in \ntheir attempts to get some kind of action.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if I would \nagree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did \nsay that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a \nnetwork in the United States and upon which we took appropriate \naction.  But there was no specific information on this specific \noperation at all.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So, the White House doesn't feel that any of the \nlaw enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have \nreceived this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in \nnot pursuing some kind of --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's next with Serbia?  It got only a passing \nmention in the news conference yesterday --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn't get to ask your \nquestion.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted \naction between the two countries?  And even if there wasn't, what \ndoes the U.S. do next?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going \nto move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our \nallies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways \nto press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an \nagreement.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, why do you think sanctions is still an \noption?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the \nleadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait \nyou out and even the administration officials we had in the other day \nsaid there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any \ntime soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When \ndoes no mean no and you have to do something different?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something \ndifferent.  We're moving forward on further sanctions through the \nU.N. and those discussions will continue.  We're going to continue to \ntry and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every \nopportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo? \nMR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something \nthat is under consideration.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's \ncondition, how he's doing?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing's changed.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a little unclear.  I think \nwe'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning \nafter the Mubarak visit.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he going somewhere for Easter?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What more can you tell us about the additional aid \nto Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's going to be consulting with \nthe Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.  \nI know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their \ndelegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the \nRussians this week and those consultations will continue over the \nnext several weeks.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude \nof the one announced Sunday?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to discuss the \nmagnitude.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where \ndo you stand on that --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday, \nhe's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week \nand reviewing it.  He believes -- he's going to try and get it this \nweek and he's going to review the list, and we're going to take a \nhard look at it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But they're making it up?  I mean it's no White \nHouse involvement, Congress is compiling this list?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he's going to talk to the \ncongressional leaders about compiling the list but I'm certain we'll \nbe able to get our own researchers working as well.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a \nprobability than a possibility?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's something that's under \ndiscussion.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Secretary Christopher has said that it's a matter \nof time and -- for months before that happens.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it's \nsomething that the President is reviewing.  Right now we're working \nwith our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we'll \ncontinue to review other matters.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, can you tell us anything about the schedule \nthis week?  Any travel?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They just asked about that.  I \ndon't have anything more beyond tomorrow's visit with Mubarak right \nnow.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish \nAmerican organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know the National Conference \nof Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- as you know, the National \nConference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 200 Refuseniks.  \nWe'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate \ndiscussions.\n\t     \n\t     Thanks.\n", "label": 18}

In the San Jose area we have a population of 800,000\nand that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  In contrast, Kamloops,\nBritish Columbia has a population of about 50,000 and has 5 rinks!  There\nare also myriad ponds, pools, etc that freeze in the winter.  Down here\nit's hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there it's hard to find a kid\nwithout a pair of skates.  And before you say \"what does he know? He's from\nCalifornia.\" let me say that I was born and raised in Trail, British Columbia,\na town of about 8,000 with lots of ice in the winter.  My father did radio\nplay by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, were\nthe last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).  I was\non skates almost as soon as I could walk, and have been playing recreational\nhockey for about 35 years.\n\n\n\nLack of ice is a big factor, but costs is a bigger factor.  Both my kids play for\nthe Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended,\ncost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for club\ndues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club dues\ncover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unless\nthe city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.\n\nBy the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the \"inner city\"\nareas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ... Redwood City's rink is in an\nindustrial area on Bay Rd, near 101, Berkeley's is near Ashby and Martin Luther\nKing, Stockton's is in Oak Park, Sacramento's is in an older section of downtown\n(I forget the name of the street), Fresno's is out on the edge of town, just west\nof 99.  Santa Rosa's is a nice rink, but it's in an older section of town.\nDublin's is outside of town, off 580.  Most of the rinks are old, and expensive\nto run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy ice\ntime expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.  Some of them\ngive you a 60 minute hour for your money; others give you a 50 minute hour and\ninclude the resurfacing time in the fee.\n\n", "label": 10}

Americans have become so insensitive to the needs\nof others and so completely wrapped up in themselves that they cannot see\nstraight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obvious\nmoral decisions based on reality.\n\nIf a man abandons a woman to care for their child on her own, he is not\nconsidered to be a very respectable or decent man by anyone.  This man has\nfled his responsibility, has behaved like a lazy coward, and has turned\naway from his responsibility to his wife and child.\n\nHowever, if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden,\nshe is not thought of in the same way.  When the man abandons, the woman\nsuffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life.\nWhen the woman abandons, the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed\nout, and the man has no choice, and the man sometimes suffers so badly that\nhe wishes he could trade places with his child.\n\nThs root of this whole problem is selfishness--the arrogance that says, \"My\nfeelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung.\"\nAnd when you come down to it, this is the substance of what hell is made of.\nIt's the reason a loving God can throw selfish people to the devil and his\ndemons for all of eternity.

As it is now, we don't see our\nresponsibility because we kill it and get it out of sight.  The media\nbacks us completely.  Real responsibility does not sell.

This is the root behind justification of every evil, of every\ncorruption in government, of every slanderous remark, of every lie, and\nof every murder.

They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of \nOttoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines \ngenocide as acting with a \n\n  'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a \n   national, ethnic, racial or religious group.' \n\nHistory shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate \nthe Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the \nArmenians.

The blood-thirsty leaders of \nthe x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the \nextermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor \nthose who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians. \n\nThe eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established,\nbeyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people\nduring the war were planned and premeditated.

Free options\n\tThe BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2.\n\tAny other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will\n\tbe more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86\n\tis listed below.\n\n\tX386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was\n\tdone by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com).\n\tIt supports a wide variety of SVGA boards.\n\tThere are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4,\n\tX386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you\n\tdon't need to patch it into the MIT source any more).\n\tX386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).\n\n2.

What is XFree86?\n\n   XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with\n   X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and\n   other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:\n\n    1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,\n       selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require\n       an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of\n       1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by\n       default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield\n       up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.\n    2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default\n       operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now\n       equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately\n       20% faster than X386 1.2.\n    3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,\n       or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4\n       with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from\n       SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.\n    4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.\n       Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about\n       the ATI and Trident drivers.\n    5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's\n       code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).\n    6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is\n       compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the\n       contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.\n    7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font\n       renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary\n       distributions.\n    8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.\n    9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA\n       cards is now included.\n\n   The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2\n   (they were not in XFree86 1.1):\n\n    1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of\n       available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200 \n       (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).\n    2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the\n       monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a \"two\n       headed\" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only\n       been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).\n    3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.\n    4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to\n       consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for\n       more information.)\n    5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some \n       versions of these devices were not previously compatible).\n    6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor\n       timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous\n       documentation and a lot of experimentation).\n    7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including\n       implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many \n       vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more \n       information).\n    8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has\n       been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of\n       0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks\n       line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.\n    9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig\n       configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative\n       and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new\n       options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1) \n       manual page for more information on the format of this file).\n\n       Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file\n       in the source distribution for full details.\n\n   Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the\n   current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.\n\n4. What OSs are supported?\n\n    XFree86 supports:\n\tSVR4.2: Consensys V4.2\n\tSVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC\n\tSVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2\n\tLinux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1\n\n\tBSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active\n\tBSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.\n\n\tNote that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,\n\tbut anyone should feel free to submit patches.\n\tIf you are interested in tackling this, send mail to\n\txfree86@physics.su.oz.au\n\n5. What video hardware is supported?\n\n   At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:\n\n\tTseng ET4000\n\tTseng ET3000\n\tParadise PVGA1\n\tWestern Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of\n\t\tthe PVGA1, and use its driver)\n\tGenoa GVGA\n\tTrident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000\n\tATI 18800, 28800\n\n\tAll of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,\n\twith the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in\n\t256 color mode.\n\n\tThe monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of\n\tvideo memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the\n\tET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome\n\tserver, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.\n\n\tIt appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to\n\tnon-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To\n\tavoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86\n\t1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel\n\tclock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are\n\tdiscovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how\n\tthese programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such\n\ta program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with\n\tfuture XFree86 releases.\n\n\tIf you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,\n\tit is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the\n\tOrchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not\n\twork with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details.\n\tIn fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond\n\tproducts, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions\n\tof code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).\n\tIf you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.\n\n\tSome people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA\n\tvideo cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the\n\tCPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It\n\tcould be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset\n\ton the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot\n\tof access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested\n\ttheory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not\n\tworking on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86\n\tworking fine on them.\n\n6. What about accelerated boards?\n\n\tAt this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards\n\tlike the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available\n\tin commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).\n\n\tAn S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact\n\t<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.\n\n\tA beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>\n\tor <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.\n\n7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?\n\n\tThe reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the\n\t16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory\n\tcontains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-\n\tplanes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each\n\tof each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-\n\tbuffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled\n\t16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code\n\tcould be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure).\n\tBut for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer\n\timplementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,\n\tbut nothing is yet available from the project.\n\n8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?\n\n\tObviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run\n\tX efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.\n\tThe various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending\n\ton the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).\n\tTo build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will\n\tbe required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable \n\tlower bound.\n\n9. Where can I get source for XFree86?\n\n\tSource patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22\n\tfrom MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:\n\t\texport.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)\n\t\tftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)\n\t\tftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)\n\t(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)\n\n\tRefer to the README file under the specified directory for information\n\ton which files you need to get to build your distribution.\n\n10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?\n\n\tBinaries are available via anonymous FTP from:\n\t\tftp.physics.su.oz.au\t\t- SVR4 binaries\n\t\t\tunder /XFree86/SVR4\n\t\tftp.win.tue.nl\t\t\t- SVR4 binaries\n\t\t\tunder /pub/XFree86/SVR4\n\t\tferkel.ucsb.edu\t\t\t- SVR4 binaries\n\t\t\tunder /pub/SVR4/XFree86\n\t\tstasi.bradley.edu\t\t- SVR4 binaries\n\t\t\tunder /pub/XFree86/SVR4\n\t\tblancmange.ma.utexas.edu\t- SVR3 (ISC) binaries\n\t\t\tunder /pub/ISC\n\t\tftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries\n\t\t\tunder /pub/pc/isc/XFree86\n\t\ttsx-11.mit.edu\t\t\t- Linux binaries\n\t\t\tunder /pub/linux/packages/X11\n\t\tagate.berkeley.edu\t\t- 386BSD binaries\n\t\t\tunder /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86\n\t\tftp.cs.uwm.edu\t\t\t- Mach binaries\n\t\t\tunder /i386\n\n\tEnsure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may\n\tarchive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will\n\tcontain a README file that describes what files you need to take\n\tfrom the archive, and which compile-time option selections were\n\tmade when building the distribution.\n\nIV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?\n\n11. Installation directories\n\n\tThe top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot\n\t(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include\n\tfiles, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.\n\n\tThis can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified\n\tvia symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is\n\tnonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed\n\talongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.\n\n12. Configuration files\n\n\tThe XFree86 server reads a configuration file (\"Xconfig\") on startup.\n\tThe search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in\n\tthe server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.\n\n13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes\n\n\tDavid E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known\n\tclock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.\n\tThe database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and\n\tis in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is\n\talso available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on\n\texport.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated\n\toccasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the\n\tsettings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to\n\tDavid for inclusion in the database.\n\n\tIf this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file \n\twith XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.\n\tIt may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use\n\tthis description to get them right.  When you do, send the information\n\tto David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.\n\n\tNOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and\n\t      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot\n\t      clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from\n\t      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The\n\t      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.\n\t      You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your\n\t      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up\n\t      starting the server in the future.\n\n14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit\n\n\tIf you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to\n\treconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is\n\tfully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.\n\nV) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?\n\n\tFirst of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).\n\n15. SVR4\n\tWhy won't my xterm run properly?\n\n\tIf your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define\n\tCONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run.\n\tcsh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'\n\n\tThe Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping\n\tproblems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be\n\tinstalled.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.\n\n16. SVR3\n\n\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.\n\n17. 386BSD\n\n\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.\n\n\tAlso, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey\n\t<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the\n\tfile XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:\n\n\t    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\n\t    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\n\t    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\n\n18. Linux\n\n\tYou must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc\n\tjump libraries installed.\n\n\tMake sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.\n\n\tIf your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to\n\trun the server as \"X -pn\". The default startup configuration assumes\n\tthat TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files\n\t/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the\n\t-pn argument to X386.\n\n\tMake sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major\n\tnumber 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not\n\towned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit\n\tconsole output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but\n\tstartx won't.\n\n\tWhen running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with\n\ta tty, for example \"xdm < /dev/console &\".\n\n\tFor more detailed information, please read the file README present\n\twith the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.\n\n19. Mach\n\n\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.\n\nVI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?\n\n\tThis section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is\n\tfully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.\n\tPlease look at those files for information on building XFree86.\n\nVII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?\n\n20. BSD compatibility library\n\n\tA lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.\n\tThe default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a\n\twhich contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),\n\tseed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include\n\t<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro\n\tdefinitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are\n\tlinking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these\n\tfunctions, then you should link with libXbsd.a\n\n21. ANSICCOPTIONS\n\n\tThis is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the\n\tANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite\n\tthe entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see\n\tsomething like\n\t\tCCOPTIONS=\"-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings\"\n\tand to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put\n\t\tCCOPTIONS=\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\"\n\tin his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of\n\t\tANSICCOPTIONS=\"-ansi\"\n\t\tCCOPTIONS=\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\"\n\tand all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:\n\t\tANSICCOPTIONS=\n\tto get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death\n\twith -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because\n\tCCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must\n\tadd 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.\n\nXFree86 Contact Information\n\n    Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86\n    Core Team.

If my experiences say that \"there exists no god\"\nand yours says there does, where does that leave us?  Since we are only\ngoing on experiences, then both of us are correct within our own personal\nrealities.\n\nFurthermore, the trouble with \"feelings and experiences\" is that they\ncan lead you astray, as the tragic outcome of Waco illustrates.  I\nam sure that many of Koresh's followers really believed in him but\nI think that you and I will agree that they were being misled.\n\nFinally, how on earth do you come to the conclusion that the physical\nsphere is not self-explanatory when you only rely on the five senses?\n\n\nYou must be using a definition of \"evidence\" that I am not familiar with.\nTo me, evidence is something you can show others -unambiguously- that\nwhat you are saying is true.\n\nHowever, I agree with you that belief in a diety is a matter of faith.\nIt is not something you can share around - others must experience it\nindependantly.  Unfortunately, as I have explained above, this puts\nbelief down to a matter of experience.  My impression is that Christians\ndo not have the monopoly on reason, evidence and faith as far as any of\nthese things can go.\n\n\nAt the risk of repeating my argument : As I have explained previously, \nthe trouble is that Moslems, Buddhists, Jews, etc will ALL say that THEY\nclaim, with good reason, to be a valid system, possessed of the best\nevidence, for explaining Gods revelations to man (for Buddhists it\nshould read \"for explaining the non-existence of God\").  So not only\nmust you \"prove\" your own case, you have to \"disprove\" theirs.\n\n(alt.messianic is a good place to see people strong in the belief\nof their own faiths ... and with their own good reasons)\n\n\nI know that ALL people can use reason ... I never claimed that they don't.\nI just wish to make sure that their arguments are well-founded.  It goes\nwithout saying that if I make a blunder that I expect people to correct\nme.  Once we have all gone through this process of removing the \nnon-essential and contradictory bits, we should (hopefully) have made\nsome progress towards the truth.\n\n", "label": 15}

The Bible is far\n: from universally accepted.  The Bible is NOT a proof of god;\n: it is only a proof that some people have thought that there\n: was a god.  (Or does it prove even that?

Others steered clear of such puzzle books because \nthey were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern \nmathematics and didn't mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn't \nknow how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were \nno exception. Here's what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a \nspecialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: \"I willingly confess that \nany time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was\na hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of \nmy friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route\n--constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid \nusing algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it's a fact that is \nwell known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates, \nnor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers\n(nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It \nseems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade \nteachers.\"\n\nNow, I'm not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the \nbookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to \nrecommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most \nfastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a \nrelatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to\nVenus and back.\n\n\t\t\tOne for the \"road\"\n\n\tThey both took out the books they brought for the road. Kingsley \n\tglanced at the Royal Astronomer's book and saw a bright cover with \n\ta group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. \"God \n\tknows what this kind of stuff leads to,\" thought Kingsley.\n\n\tThe Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley's book and saw the History \n\tof Herodotus. \"Good Lord, next he'll be reading Thucydides,\" thought \n\tthe Royal Astronomer.\n\t\t\t\t\t--Fred Hoyle, The Black Cloud\n\nThe book I'm talking about isn't very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24 \nelegant miniatures from seventh-century Armenia. Naive and wise at the same\ntime, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these \nproblems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian \narchitecture, the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is \nnow Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant \nletters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of \nKomitas, or the paintings of Saryan.\n\nAn edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a \nbibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutions\nof Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh \nCentury (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918).\n\nThe abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way \nof life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and \nworked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years \nthe book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in \nArmenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn't let just\nanyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk \nFather Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has \nbrought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the \ngeneral reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable \nproblem book.\n\n\t\tVardapet Anania of Shirak\n\n\tOnce fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no \n\tphilosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering \n\tit the mother of all wisdom.\n\t\t\t\t\t--Anania of Shirak\n\nAmong ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because \nof the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his \nwork. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems and\nSolutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation\nof scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, and\nArmenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the last\nwork was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia, \nMovses of Khoren).\n\nIn his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself:\n\n\tI, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of our\n\tArmenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately, \n\tin the expression of the psalmist, \"every day I illuminated the \n\teyes of my mind.\" Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation,\n\tI came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy, \n\tthe mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia \n\tneither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the \n\tsciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man \n\tnamed Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told me\n\tthat in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician,\n\tChristosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But \n        soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but \n        only of certain fragmentary facts.\n\n\tI then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me: \n\t\"Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the \n\tcoast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full \n\tof wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature.\" I asked \n\tthem how they knew this. They answered: \"We saw ourselves that many \n\tpeople traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man. \n\tIndeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople,\n\tPhilagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become \n\tpupils of Tyukhik.\" When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to \n\tGod, who had quenched the thirst of His slave.\n\n\tI went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I \n\tHe sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St. \n\tGregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself \n\tlived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there.\" \n\tVardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with \n\tme. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated \n\tthe science of number, and with such success that my fellow students\n\tat the king's court began to envy me.\n\n\tI spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not \n\tbeen translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable \n\tcollection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan, \n\tbooks on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why \n\tenumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did \n\tnot have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating\n\tthat when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into \n\tArmenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the \n\ttranslation read as if the work were written in that language \n\toriginally.\n\n\tTyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had \n\tlearned the Armenian language. \"When I was young,\" he said, \"I lived \n\tin Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and \n\tfor a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I \n\tserved as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and \n\tliterature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was \n\twounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to \n\tthe Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: \"If You prolong my life, \n\tI shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to \n\tcollecting treasures of knowledge.\" And the Lord heard my prayers. \n\tAfter I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria \n\tand Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher \n\tfrom Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned \n\tto my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people.\"\n\n\tAfter some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for \n\thim, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to \n\tassume the teacher's position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to \n\tGod not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But because\n\tof his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study \n\twith him.\n\n\tAnd I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from \n\thim this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our \n\tcountry, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God's \n\thelp, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me \n\tfor my efforts.\n\n\t\t\t\tProblems and Solutions\n\n\tA half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed\n\ton verge'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper; \n\tone forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and \n\tforty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many \n\tcopies were printed in all.\n\t\t\t\t\t--Imitation of Anania of Shirak\n\nA Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli (\"books have their own fate\").\nThe fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. The\nmanuscripts of Anania's book were preserved only because, according to \nArmenian historians, \"in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded \nfrom invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one's own children.\" Biding\ntheir time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of \nancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts).\nAnd its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two \nmanuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction \nand commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited, \nannotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a \nmember of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR).\n\nIn the translator's words, the problems of Anania are \"amusing, full of life, \nand simple.\" Orbeli goes on to say: \"The subjects of the problems are \ngenerally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland \nShirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are \nnamed, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a \ncontemporary of Anania.\" Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used \nonly \"aliquots\" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it is\nnecessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to \nrepresent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above).\n\nLike any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the \nretelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their \nfull glory. So let's open Anania's problem book--a gift from across the ages.\n\nProblems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D. \n572.\n\nProblem 1\n\nMy father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the \nArmenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary \nheroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops. \nThe first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time, \npursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third \ntime, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were \nstill alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from \nthis remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre.\n\nProblem 8\n\nDuring the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when Zaurak\nKamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the\nPersian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a \nday. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent \nriders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in \na day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy.\n\nProblem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian \ntranslation, they are all called \"dishes.\" But in the original Armenian, \naccording to Orbeli's note, the dishes in the first and second instances are \ncalled mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian \nword, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before \nAnania's Problems and Solutions.\n\nProblem 18\n\nThere was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the \nmetal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; from\none fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten \ndrams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray.\n\nSeveral of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in \nAnania's time -- for instance, problem 7.\n\nProblem 7\n\nOnce I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank \nof the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast. \nWe caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slipped\nout of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found \nforty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all.\n\nThe temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I'll restrain myself\nand offer you just one more.\n\nProblem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that \ninhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no\nmention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according \nto the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of \nShirak offers evidence to the contrary .\n\nProblem 20\n\nThe hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik, \nwas at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wild\ndonkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and, \nrunning to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived with\nhis brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild \nbeasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by \narrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were \ncaught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And \nso, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre.\n\n\t\t\"Set in type by me, Iosef Orbeli\"\n\n\tHis biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a \n\tbibliography.\n\t\t\t\t-- K Uzbashyan, Academician\n\t\t\t\t\tIosef Abgarovich Orbeli\n\nAnyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the \nsolution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation \nof Anania of Shirak's Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages,\nhas probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders, \nand the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great \nattention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for \na degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma \nattesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An \nadvertisement at the end of the book reads: \"This book was typeset in \nDecember 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by \nme, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with \nborders by me. Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project \nto the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by M. Strolman.\"\n\nTypesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned \norientalist Iosef Orbeli, who later became the director of the Hermitage \nMuseum in Leningrad. He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. Orbeli had \nalready become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis \nAcademiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its \nrich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. In preparing to publish \nthe corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian \nchurches, Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve \nthe unique signs and ligatures. This complicated work was done by M. G.\nStrolman. (Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the \nblockade of Leningrad in World War II.)\n\nWhen Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences, times \nwere hard. The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Anania\nwas for Orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the \nprinter's craft). In 1922 Orbeli became the director of printing at the \nAcademy of Sciences. Even after he retired, he remained a tireless champion\nof Russian academic typography.\n\n\t\t\tBack to Earth\n\n\tThis book by definition does not exhaust all the most important \n\tworks in this domain. The editor hopes that those who are guilty \n\tof this incompleteness will read these lines and, stung by shame, \n\twill work up, if not a collection like this, at least a monograph.\n\n\t\t\t--V.

Maybe one of the space travelers will take \nthis very copy of Quantum, and another, looking over her shoulder, will read \nthis article and say to himself: \"This Anania from Shirak seems like a pretty \ninteresting guy. When I get home I'll try to find his problems.\"\n\nGood luck, my young friend! Anania is sure to entertain you. Perhaps by then\nthere will be more than n copies of his timeless Problems and Solutions. And \nwe can hope they will be as lovingly printed as the masterpieces created by \nIosef Orbeli.\n\n[1] Vardapet (or vartabed) means teacher or learned man in Armenian.

Our lads at the fort were asked to cook up\nsomething that's pretty secure, with a key that can be escrowed neatly,\nand they did. The government plans to sell this thing, for the reasons\nthey state. Yes, those evil guys in the FBI can probably, with some\neffort, abuse the system.

{"text": "I replied to this query via e-mail, but I think there are some\nissues that are worth discussing in public.\n\n\nI would recommend you to take a look at\n\n1) your dictionary\n2) alt.atheism FAQ files\n\nto notice that atheism is _not_ a belief system, and what is common\nto all atheists is not a belief, but a _lack of belief in deities_.\nI cannot imagine how anyone could do research on atheism without\npaying careful attention to this issue. \n\n\nIMHO, this is a poor method to do any real survey, although I'm sure the\nreplies might keep you amused for hours.\n\n\nNo, I do _not_ know what you mean. If you are surveying our individual\nphilosophies, fine, but that's not strictly atheism. Atheism is not\njust another, godless version of the theistic explanations for life,\nthe universe and everything. It is not a belief system, and it could\nhardly be called a philosophical system.\n\nOnce more: Atheism is characterised by lack of belief in deities. \nDo not twist the meaning, or assume that we have some kind of\nphilosophy we all agree on.\n\nSome comments on your questions:\n\n\nI would also like to hear more about this. Have we been able to 'convert'\nanyone?\n\n\nThis question contains a contradiction in terms. _Beliefs_ \ncannot be acquired rationally - if they could, they would not be \nbeliefs! You also seem to have rather strange ideas of how people become\natheists - those who are alienated from religion do not necessarily\nbecome atheists, they just think very little about religion. It seems\nit requires a considerable time of honest inquiry to find out that\nreligions are actually intellectually dishonest virtual realities.\n\nThose who have never had beliefs will certainly find this question\nquite odd - how can lack of belief be acquired? When did I acquire\nlack of belief in the Easter Bunny? (I did believe in Santa, though ;-))\n\n\nThis question does not make any sense, since atheism does not deal with\nthese issues - it is not a worldview, or a philosophy, or a belief system.\n\nSigh, why haven't I seen a good, well-thought survey in the Usenet\nfor three years... and what is the point of doing surveys in the net,\nanyway?

{"text": "\n\nThis is not the case: the ROM on the P9000 supports VESA modes of up to\n1024x768 in 256 colors.  VESA-compliant applications should have no trouble\nsetting these modes. (But I'm forwarding your posting to our Software group,\njust in case.  Can't be too careful.)  Not that I doubt that YOUR applications\nare failing to run; lots of stuff depends on figuring out which exact SVGA\nthey're looking at, and don't use VESA calls (VESA is still pretty new).\nEvery new chip set confuses them.\n\n\nI think we go to AT LEAST 76 Hz at 1024x768x8, and maybe more (and\nit's a function of the RAMDAC speed, not the Power 9000). We need to\nfix the problems you've noted (they were already on the list).  If\nyou're really interested, though, take a look at the text file\nP9000RES.DAT, which holds the data from which the choices in the\nP9000 monitor installation program are built.  Working by analogy,\nyou can build up a new monitor definition that has the right\ncombinations of refresh rates for your monitors.  Keep a backup copy\nof the file!  Once you've built a new version of the P9000RES.DAT\nfile, run the P9000 installation program, INST, and your new choices\nshould show up.  (This assumes you have the WEITEK v. 2.2 drivers.\nYou can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of\nthe driver: 02:20 is version 2.20.  Microsoft uses this gimmick,\ntoo.)\n\n\nThe SPEEDY benchmark was put out by Hercules and IIT, who to my\nknowledge were unencumbered by any motivations except making the\nHercules Graphite/IIT AGX014 card look really good.  So I'd take the\nnumbers with a ton of salt. (Texas Instruments did the same thing\nwith WINTACH, trying to make the 34020 look good compared to the\n8514, as if anyone cared.)  It's safer (though not safe) to use\nbenchmarks from \"unbiased\" sources, such as testing labs, columnists,\netc.\n\n\n\nI think you'll a large discrepancy between the results of SPEEDY and\nthe results of anything else in the universe on these things.\n\n\nFont caching is a perfectly legitimate optimization -- Windows has\nhooks for it built right into the GDI.  What's kind of silly is IIT's\nuse of a hardwired \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog then\nsat on a tack\" string in their driver.  Not only is it useless in\nreal applications, it lacks the programming elegance of the \"Bart\nSimpson optimization,\" in which you save the bitmap of the\nmost-recently drawn string in off-screen memory, and just do a\nscreen-to-screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string a\nsecond time in a row.  (We call it the \"Bart Simpson optimization\"\nbecause Bart's the only person we can see benefiting from it: he\ncould right \"I will not cheat on benchmarks\" a hundred times and be\ndone in half the time it would take to actually form each character.)\n\n\nWe don't have any lawyers -- they're all working for Intel.

{"text": "Can a theist be truly objective?  Can he be impartial\n     when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or\n     will he assume the superstition of his parents\n     when questioning? \n\nI've often found it to be the case that the theist\n     will stick to some kind of superstition when\n     wondering about God and his scriptures.  I've\n     seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,\n     and the other theists alike.  All assume that\n     their mothers and fathers were right in the\n     aspect that a god exists, and with that belief\n     search for their god.\n     \nOccasionally, the theist may switch religions or\n     aspects of the same religion, but overall the\n     majority keep to the belief that some \"Creator\"\n     was behind the universe's existence.  I've\n     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice\n     versa, I've known Christians who were once\n     Jewish and vice versa, and I've even known\n     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout\n     their transition from one faith to another,\n     they've kept this belief in some form of higher\n     \"being.\"  Why?\n     \nIt usually all has to do with how the child is\n     brought up.  From the time he is born, the\n     theist is brought up with the notion of the\n     \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\n     the Torah, the Qur'an, & etc.  He is told\n     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\n     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\n     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.\n     He is also told that to question this (as\n     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\n     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\n     ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell.\n     Thus, by the time he is able to read the\n     scripture for himself, the belief in its \"truth\"\n     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\n     matter of course.\n     \nBut it doesn't stop there.  Once the child is able\n     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to\n     inculcate the child the \"right\" readings of\n     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant\n     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to\n     explain away the unexplainable with \"mystery.\"\n     Circular arguments, \"self-evdent\" facts and\n     \"truths,\" unreasoning belief, and fear of\n     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat\n     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath\n     of some sort, and the child must learn to put\n     away his brain when the matter concerns God.\n     All of this has some considerable effect on the\n     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the \n     superstitions he's been taught are nearly\n     impossible to remove.\n     \nAll of this leads me to ask whether the theist can\n     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,\n     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.\n     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that\n     God *does* exist and look at everything from\n     a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most\n     theists can somewhat, especially when presented\n     with \"mythical gods\" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,\n     & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption\n     of God's existence and question it impartially?\n     \nStephen\n\n    _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/       _/    * Atheist\n   _/        _/    _/   _/ _/ _/ _/     * Libertarian\n  _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/   _/  _/      * Pro-individuality\n       _/  _/     _/  _/       _/       * Pro-responsibility\n_/_/_/_/  _/      _/ _/       _/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...\n\n-- ", "label": 15}

{"text": "Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this \"Banner\" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the \"Environmental\nBillboard\".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the \"Environmental\nBillboard\" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable 'frame'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry \"ozone reading\nsensors\" to \"continuously monitor the condition of the Earth's\ndelicate protective ozone layer,\" according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth's\natmosphere. According to IMI, \"as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer.\" The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and \"adds to the ozone supply.\"\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising 'unit' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian's questions:\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it's probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can't piggy back upon\nsomeone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That's a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don't think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don't really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\nidiot?)\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it's in a low\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that's the time\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven't heard of any serious funding\nfor this, but I'm sure they are shopping the venture around looking\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\n  \n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\nmy guest.  I don't have posting privileges to that area (or at least\nI don't THINK I do...).\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor", "label": 14}

{"text": "The following are my thoughts on a meeting that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly\nhad with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and\ncommercial space.  This is how it went...\n\n\n\nAfter receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,\nI called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty\nMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard\nthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.\nLater in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.\n\nWe got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,\nwho scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not\nbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to \nmake sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.\n\nWell, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking\nto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.\nWe covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  \nMost of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another\nwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that\nwe brought up.\n\nBut, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate\naligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.\nSo, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to\nLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming \nfeasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.\nWe hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism\npaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the\natmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog\nover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is \nmore pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to \nunderstanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education \nwhereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that\nthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other\nfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday \nwould provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.\n\nWe hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business\nangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal\ncommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided\nin those sectors.\n\nJobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..\nWe mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.\n\nWe left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order\nto make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.\n\nWe ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are\nproceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the\nresults from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),\nand most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along\nthe lines of lowering the cost to LEO.\n\nIn the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data \nPurchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.\nHe asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,\nand contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually\nhappen immediatly there.\n\nThe last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we\nknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they\ncould feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know\nthe answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who\nreally did know the answers.\n\nThen finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He\nsaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this\nwould be something that she would be very interested in, although they\ndo have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the\nstate 1 week out of 6 these days.\n\nAll in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.", "label": 14}

{"text": "[ . . .]\n\nI am a relativist who would like to answer your question, but the way you\nphrase the question makes it unanswerable.  The concepts of \"right\"\nand \"wrong\" (or \"correct/incorrect\" or \"true/false\") belong to the\ndomain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no\nsense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is\nlegitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).\n\nLet me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives\nof epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively.\nOne can certainly ask if a percept is \"right\" (correct, true,\nveridical) or \"wrong\" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little\nsense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is\nstrange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can\ncertainly ask that question about motives.\n\nTherefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can't be considered:\nthey assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.\n\nNow the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with\nthe first part (that the \"rightness\" of a moral position is a\nmeaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  But that is\nirrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that\none cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can make\nvalue judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the \"correctness\"\nof the position.\n\nSorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer is\nthat when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue,\nneither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).

Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly\nand calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their\nrepresentatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan\nSSR.\n\nWe are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we \nare for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one\nof the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic \nRepublic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.\n\nBut all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the\nSoviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists\nencouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000\nYear Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the \nneighboring lands.\n\nThe world public opinion shed tears to save the whales,\nsuffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.\n\nBut what about the lives of seven million human beings?\nIf these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are\nless valuable?

Rather than use technology to accommodate\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\n\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\n\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\ncommercial use today.\n\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \n\nA \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\n\"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\n\n\n                                2\n\n\n\"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\nin two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\nwiretap.\n\nThe \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\nconversations of Americans.\n\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\ntheir findings.\n\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\nencryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\n\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\n\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\n\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\n          technology to build the National Information\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\n          marketplace; and \n\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\n          high technology products.\n\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\n\n\n\n                                3\n\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\n(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone\nsystem transmits voice.\n\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\nprotect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting\nthem from those who break the law.\n\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \nThe provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new\nencryption technology are also available.  \n\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\n\n\n\n\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\n\nA:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\n     conversations of Americans.\n\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\n     decipher the message?\n\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\n     escrow system.\n\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\n\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\n\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\n     how strong the security is?  \n\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\n     vulnerabilities.\n\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\n\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\n     officials.\n\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\n\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\n     decisions related to this initiative.\n\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\n\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\n     manufacturer that produces them.\n\nQ:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\n\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\n     to other vendors in the future.\n\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \n\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\n     the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\n     \nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\n     powerful encryption devices?\n\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\n     developing.\n\n     The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\n     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\n     false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\n     an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\n     Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\n\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\n     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \n\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\n     and terrorism.\n\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\n     the government hardware?", "label": 11}

{"text": "Ok, let me see if I can get all this out concisely.  I am on an\ninformation gathering venture regarding the various expressions of\nChristianity/churches there are.  \n        My husband and I come from very different, but completely\nChristian backgrounds.  I was a Lutheran when I met him and he was a\nborn and raised Church of Christ member.  At first I agreed with a lot\nof what the C of C was about, I wanted to move from the liturgical\nbased Lutheran church to something a little more Biblical based.\nHowever over the last year, I've been regretting changing to the\nChurch of Christ for a number of reasons - for one thing I am not a\nfundamentalist and believe that a few things in the Bible are\nsocio-cultural in nature and don't relate to the Christian doctrine.\nOne of my sorest spots is the role of women.  I believe that through\nMary and other women, Chris validated women as worthy disciples - but\nin the C of C the writings of Paul are taken without exception and I\nam told that I am not an equal partner in my marriage but the lesser\nmember, I am to submit to my husband in all things (if I hear that\nverse one more time....) and I am not to take an active role in\nanything which might be construed as putting me in authority over men\n(ie leading prayers, conducting Bible studies etc).   The last straw\nwas when the Elders at our church came down on one of our college\ngroups because it was all-women and they wanted a man to lead the\nstudy.\nAlso my husband and I really resent the way everyone at our church\nfeels that if you aren't a conservative republican - you aren't a REAL\nChristian (I got told that nobody who voted for Clinton should call\nthemselves a Christian).

I want a reasonably\nbiblical based church where women are viewed as whole people no matter\nwhat their calling ( C of C really looked down on career women).\nChristopher is looking for a church with deeply rooted religious\nconvictions, with adult baptism and a church where the members still\nbring their Bibles to service.\n\nWe are so confused here and we're drifting around trying to find a\nplace where we both feel loved and can express our faith honestly and\nwithout reservation.  If anyone can point us in a direction we'd be\nthrilled!\nI'm afraid that it will be very hard for me to go back to C of C and\neven harder for me to stay churchless for long.\n\nany responses would be welcome\n\n\nthe diel family", "label": 15}

EDT\n\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Ladies and gentlemen, \ntwo months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our \nnational deficit and to increase our investment in the American \npeople, their jobs and their economic future.  The federal budget \nplan passed Congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope \nand opportunity in the country.  \n\t     \n\t     Then, the short-term jobs plan I presented to Congress, \nwhich would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed \nthe House of Representatives two weeks ago.  It now has the support \nof a majority of the United States Senate. \n\t     \n\t     All of these members of Congress know it's time to get \nthe economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a \nfast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity.  \nUnfortunately, a minority of the members of the United States Senate \nhave used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working \nthe will of the majority on the jobs bill.\n\t     \n\t     When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every \nstate and from both parties to remember what is at stake.  The issue \nis not politics, it's people.  Sixteen million of them are looking \nfor full-time jobs and can't find them.  These men and women don't \ncare about who's up or down in Washington.  They care about paying \nthe rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the \ntable and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of \ndignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their \nfamilies and drawing a paycheck.\n\t     \n\t     They're asking those of us who have the privilege of \nserving to put aside politics and do something now to move our \neconomy forward.  I am prepared to do that.  And I have been working \nwith the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some \nof the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs \nplan.  I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on \njobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet \nnational needs.  \n\t     \n\t     Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package.  \nToday I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what \nsize package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of \nthe American people. \n\t     \n\t     But even as we make those reductions and the package \nwill be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the \nminds of millions of Americans, and one in particular, and that is \nthe need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the \ndramatic rise in violent crime. \n\t     \n\t     So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an \nadditional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities \nto rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the \nfiscal problems caused by the national recession.  Together, with a \nmatching effort by local governments, this could put as many as \n10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in \ncommunities all across our nation.\n\t     \n\t     At a time when too many of our people live in fear of \nviolent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many \npeople have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their \nhomes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments \nAmerica can make.  And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that \ninvestment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind.  \n\t     \n\t     I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep \nthe economy going toward recovery and to create jobs.  Make no \nmistake about it:  I will fight for these priorities as hard as I \never have.  I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight \nfor their jobs, their future and for fundamental change.\n\t     \n\t     I want to thank the police officers who are here today \nand tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here \nthat I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to \nrehire police officers.  They came here because they believe in the \nsummer jobs portion of the package.  And I want them to be free to \ntalk about that.  They came here not out of any law enforcement \nconcern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country \nto have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and \na brighter and more peaceful future.\n\t     \n\t     I say what I say today not just because it's good for \nlaw enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in \nthese communities.  I have always supported community policing not \nonly because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate, \nbut because it cements better relationships between people in law \nenforcement and the people that they're hired to protect.  It reduces \nthe chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the \nchances of harmony and safe streets at the same time.\n\t     \n\t     These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do.  \nI promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put \nanother 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four \nyears.  This makes a good downpayment on that.  This keeps in mind \nthe core of the jobs package.  And this will help us to move forward.  \n\t     \n\t     So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the \njobs bill, let's work together.  I can accept a reduced package if \nyou will increase your commitment to safe streets.  I do not accept \nthe fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to \nbuilding our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will \ncreate real and lasting  prosperity for our people.  I have done my \npart now to end the gridlock; I ask you to do yours.  \n\t     \n\t     I want now to give the people who are here with me on \nthe platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the \nAmerican people -- beginning with Janet Reno, the distinguished \nAttorney General.\n  \n\t     \n\t     *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, can you tell us -- do you think that \nthe jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over \nthe suggestion of a VAT tax at this point in the congressional \ndialogue?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Not at all.  I think it should have --\nthey wouldn't have any relationship one to the other.  First of all, \nI made absolutely no decision on that.  You should know that there's \na lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- \npeople have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden \nof the present system on many of our major employers, particularly \nmany of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the \nstrength of this economy.  But I have made absolutely no decision \nthat would even approach that on that or any other kind of general \ntax.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you personally believe that the American public \nis ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care?  I \nmean, apart from what business and labor leaders have said --\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'm not going to speculate on that.  I \nwill say this:  The real issue is how quickly we can recycle the \nbenefits of all the savings to cover the cost.  I mean, that is --\neveryone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do, if you \nstreamline the insurance system, if you fix the system so that \nthere's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or \nover-provide certain services, if you provide primary and preventive \ncare in places where it isn't now, every single analysis shows \nabsolutely massive savings to the health care system.\n\t     \n\t     The real question is whether you can transfer those \nsavings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have \nvirtually no coverage so that you provide people the security.  I \nhave no idea.  The polls say that, but I don't know.  All I know is \nthe polls that I see in the press that many of you have commissioned, \nthey say overwhelmingly the American people want the security of an \naffordable health care system.\n\t     \n\t     But I don't think that has anything to do with this \nstimulus, and it certainly shouldn't have.  People want a job first \nand foremost.  They want that more than anything else.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Now that you've announced your willingness to \ncompromise on the stimulus package, can you tell us what parts of \nyour package you consider vital and uncompromisable?  I assume summer \njobs is one.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I want the summer jobs; I want the \nhighway program and I want the police program.  I still intend -- let \nme say this:  I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime \nbill, which did not pass the Congress last year.  This is a \nsupplement to that, not a substitute for it in any way.  But I think \nwe need to do that.\n\t     \n\t     I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the \nenormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately \nand disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people \nwith AIDS.  And there are several other things that I think should be \ndone.  We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors; the \nsafety of the public depends on that.  \n\t     \n\t     There are a number of other things that I don't -- I \ndon't think any of it should be cut, but I have given Senator \nMitchell and Senator Byrd -- I talked to them.  And Senator Dole \ncalled me yesterday to discuss this, and I told him that I would call \nhim back.  I called him back last night in New Hampshire and we \ndiscussed this.  And I basically asked them to talk today, and said \nthat I would not make any statements about any specifics until at \nleast they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could \nreach some accord.  \n\t     \n\t     So I don't want to be any more specific than I have been \nalready, and let's see if they can talk it out.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  When you talked to Senator Dole and Senator \nMitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also, that $200 \nmillion, that you want that as part of the package?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I did -- I told Senator -- I left word \nfor Senator Mitchell last night about it.  When I talked to Senator \nDole -- I don't remember for sure -- I do not believe I mentioned it.  \nBut I did tell him that I was prepared to reduce the package and I \nwanted to break the gridlock, and I told him that I was working on a \nreformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even \nmore focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the \nAmerican people wanted us to address.  And this is certainly \nconsistent with that.\n\t     \n\t     Thank you.", "label": 18}

{"text": "\nI don't meant to defend Eric Molas- I find it somewhat annoying when\nsomeone pops up on alt.atheism to tell us all about his (usually\natheistic) beliefs, so I can certainly see how Christians might be\nannoyed- but I'd like to point out a few things.\n\n\n\"no meaning from God\" is not the same as \"no meaning\". From my (atheistic)\npoint of view, if you want meaning in your life, you get to go and\nget some or make some.\n\nNo free gifts of meaning. (I never quite understood how any\nGod can just \"give\" your life meaning, actually. If he\nsays you exists to do or be X, that gives you a purpose\nif you care to accept it, but is that the same thing? But\nI digress...) \n\n\nThis would truely be a miserably existance, which I doubt Eric\nendures. Life can be enjoyable, so you can live it because you like\nit, or purposefull, so you can live it to get something done. One should\nendeavour to make it so, if it is not. Otherwise it would be as you say.\nTerrible.\n\n\nProbably true. Remeber he almost certainly sees that particular joy as\nan illusion, and does not want it. So maybe it isn't so bad?\n\n\nAs an atheist, I am free to be a human person. I think, love, choose,\nand create.\n\n\nAh, now here we begin to diverge. I will not live forever\nwith anyone.\n\n(I don't think you will either, but you are welcome to your\nopinion on the matter.)\n\n\nI tend to agree with you.\n\nIt's my opinion that (unlike drugs) religions are normal\nparts of human societies.\n\nI think they have outlived their usefullness, but they\nare evidently quite ordinary, normal things that haven't\nproved lethal to humanity yet.\n\n\nI have heard this claim quite a few times. Does anybody here know\nwho first came up with the \"God-shaped hole\" business?\n\n\nYou might want to provide some evidence next time you make a claim\nlike this.\n\n\nI don't know Eric, but I do not think it is wise to assume he has a less\njoy-filled and abundant life because he holds certain beliefs.\n\n---\n\t\t\t- Dan Johnson\nAnd God said \"Jeeze, this is dull\"... and it *WAS* dull.

{"text": "\nNot to drag this out anymore, but....\n\nMany veterinarians feel that Lyme Disease in dogs is so easy to treat that\nin an endemic area, they often just give the appropriate antibiotics to dogs\npresenting with lameness, swollen joints, +/- fever.\n\nA recent paper (March 1993) has finally established that Lyme disease in dogs\ncan be reproduced in a controlled experimentaly setting.  This has been\nan ellusive matter for researchers, and is one of the fundamental requirements\nfor many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular disease.\nUp to now, only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to \"prove\" that\nthe disease exists.\n\nThis paper is noteworthy in two other regards:\n\n1) None of the animals they infected were treated in any way.  The dogs\nhad episodes of lameness during a 6-8 week period which occurred 2-5\nmonths after exposure.  After this period, none showed any further\nclinical signs up to the 17 month observation period of the study.  So\nthese are proven, clinically sick Lyme patients showing spontaneous\nrecovery without the benefit of drug treatment. Of course, observations\nlonger than 17 months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesn't\nhave the same chronicity that some see in humans.\n\n2)  The addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by the\nvaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine.  Of course, they want\nthe world to use the model they developed in order to test vaccine\nefficacy.\n\nAnyway, maybe we will see some independent, scientifically sound evaluations\nof this vaccine in the next year or so.\n", "label": 13}

{"text": ": I heard on the radio today about a Christian student conference where\n: Christians were called to \"repent\" of America's \"national\" sins, such\n: as sexual promiscuity.\n: \n: To which I reply: ...whoa there!\n: \n: How can I repent of _someone else's_ sin?   I can't.\n: \n: And when I claim to \"repent\" of someone else's sin, am I not in fact\n: _judging_ him?  Jesus equipped us to judge activities but warned us\n: not to judge people. \"Judge not that ye be not judged.\"\n: \n: C. S. Lewis made the same point in an essay after World War II,\n: when some Christian leaders in Britain were urging \"national repentance\"\n: for the horrors (sins???) of World War II.\n: -- \n\nI see your point, but I cannot more strongly disagree.\n\nTo repent means to turn around.  We, as a nation, have behaved incredibly\narrogantly toward God condoning, encouraging, and even forcing folks to\nparticipate in activity directly opposed to the written Word of God.  We\nhave arrogantly set our nation far above the God who created it and allowed\nus the luxury of living in this land.  We have set a bad example for other\nnations.  We've slaughtered unborn children by the millions.  We have\nstricken the name of God from the classroom.  We've cheated God out of the\nhonor due Him at every turn, and we owe God an apology every bit as public\nas our sins have been.\n\nWhen Jesus said \"Judge not that ye be not judged\", he was not addressing\nthose like John the Baptist who had repented and were calling others to\nrepent.  He was addressing those who remained in sin while heaping down\ncondemnation on others for their sins.  His message to us all was to remove\nthe log from our own eye before removing the speck from our brother's.  But\nHe also said to rebuke and to reprove.  Don't forget that this is a command\ntoo.\n\nOur problem today is that we tend to judge and condemn as though we were\nrebuking and we tend to neglect bringing folks back to the Lord with the\nexcuse that we don't want to judge anyone.\n\nIn truth, what we need to do is to judge less and call others to repent more\nand to be able to distinguish between the two in our own motives.  Call sin\nwhat it is and do so openly.  Let it's charge fall correctly where it should.\nBut instead of running someone into hell over it, pull them out of their\nhellward path and onto the heavenward path.\n\n--\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\"I deplore the horrible crime of child murder...\n\t We want prevention, not merely punishment.\n\t We must reach the root of the evil...\n\t It is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt\n\t from the dreadful deed...\n\t No mater what the motive, love of ease,\n\t\tor a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent,\n\t\tthe woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed...\n\t but oh! thrice guilty is he who drove her\n\t\tto the desperation which impelled her to the crime.\"", "label": 15}

{"text": "\n\nThe problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators,\nand these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.

If\nyou're a Motif implementor, I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics\nchanged to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the\ndocumentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's\nexpectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as\ntranslations.\n\n\nIf you mean \"menu accelerator\", no it's not possible.

{"text": "Heres a nice story to help explain the virtues of purity, innocence\nand modesty, and their importance.\n\n\n\n    The Most Beautiful Virtues\n\n    This story is an excerpt taken from The  Basket  of  Flowers   by\n    Johann Christoph von Schmid\n\n\n    In a certain little market town, over a hundred years ago,\tthere\n    lived  an  upright\tand  intelligent man named Jacob Rede. He was\n    married to a most virtuous young woman and they lived happily  in\n    a  humble  home which was in the midst of a large, beautiful val-\n    ley. After living many, happy years together, Jacob's wife\tdied,\n    leaving  him alone with only one friend...his daughter Mary. Even\n    as a child Mary was uncommonly pretty; but as she grew in  years,\n    her piety, her innocence, her modesty and her unfeigned kindne ss\n    towards all she came in contact with, gave to her beauty  a  rare\n    and  peculiar  charm. Her face was lighted up with a look of such\n    indescribable goodness, that  it  seemed  almost  as  though  one\n    looked upon an angel.\n\n    Mary's greatest delight was the beautiful garden and her  favour-\n    ite  flowers  were the violet, the lily and the rose. Jacob loved\n    to point to them as emblems of the virtues most becoming  to  her\n    gender.  When\tshe  once, early in March brought the first violet to\n\n    Let the modest violet, my dear Mary, be to you an image of humil-\n    ity  and  of the benevolence that does good in secret. It clothes\n    itself in the tender colours of modesty; it prefers to  bloom  in\n    retired  grots; it fills the air with its fragrance while remain-\n    ing hidden beneath the leaves.  May you also, my  dear  Mary,  be\n    like  the  retiring violet, avoiding vain display, not seeking to\n    attract the public\teye,  but  preferring  ever  to  do  good  in\n    quietude and peace.\n\n    One morning when the roses and lilies were in full bloom and  the\n    garden appeared in its richest array, Jacob said to his daughter,\n    as he pointed out a beautiful lily,  which\twas  beaming  in  the\n    morning sun:\n\n    Let the lily my dear child, be to you the emblem\n     of purity. Look how beautiful, how pure and fair it is! The whi-\n    test  linen is as nothing compared with the purity of its petals:\n    they are like the snow. Happy the maiden whose heart is  as  pure\n    and as free from stain. But the purest of all colours is also the\n    hardest\n\n\t\t\t\t   -5-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    to preserve pure. Easily is the petal of the lily  soiled;\ttouch\n    it\tbut carelessly or roughly and a stain is left behind.  In the\n    same way, a word or a thought may stain the purity of  innocence!\n\n     Let the rose my dear Mary, be to you an emblem of modesty.  More\n    beautiful  than the colour of the rose is the blush that rises to\n    the cheek of a modest girl. It is a sign that she is  still  pure\n    of\theart  and  innocent in thought. Happy is the maiden whom the\n    suggestion of a thought that is indelicate, will cause to  blush,\n    as\tshe  is thus put on her guard against the approach of danger.\n    The cheeks which readily blush will remain for a long  time  with\n    their  roseate  hue, while those which fail to blush at the least\n    indelicacy of thought will soon  become  pale  and\twan,  and  go\n    before their time to the grave.\"\n\n\n\n\n    Among the many fruit trees that adorned the garden there was  one\n    that  was  prized above all the others. It was an apple tree, not\n    much larger than a rose bush, and stood by itself in  the  middle\n    of\tthe garden. Mary's father had planted it the day that she was\n    born and every year it bore a number of beautiful apples. Once it\n    blossomed  earlier\tthan  usual  and with unusual luxuriance. The\n    tree was one mass of blossom. Mary was so delighted with it  that\n    she went every morning as soon as she was dressed to look at\n     it. Once, when it was in full bloom, she called  to  her  father\n\n    Look father, how beautiful! Was there ever such a lovely mingling\n    of\tred  and  white?  The whole tree looks like one huge bunch of\n    flowers!\n\n    The next morning she hastened into the garden to feast  her  eyes\n    once  more\tupon the tree. But what was her grief to see that the\n    frost had nipped it and destroyed all its flowers. They were  all\n    become  brown  and\tyellow\tand  when  the\tsun came forth in its\n    strength they withered and fell to the ground. Mary  wept  bitter\n    tears at the sight. Then said the father:\n\n    Thus, does sinful pleasure destroy the  bloom  of  youth.  Oh  my\n    child,  never  cease to remember how dreadful it is to be seduced\n    from the path of right! Behold in the example of the  apple  tree\n    an\timage of what would happen if you were to wander from the way\n    - if the hopes your conduct  hitherto  has\traised\tin  my\theart\n    should  vanish,  not  merely for a day or year, but for life. Ah,\n    then how much more bitter would be the tears which I  would  shed\n    over your lapse from virtue than those which now course down your\n    cheeks!

{"text": "THE DIVINE MASTERS       \n      \n               Most Christians would agree, and correctly so, that \n          Jesus Christ was a Divine Master, and a projection of God \n          into the physical world, God Incarnate. \n          \n               But there are some very important related facts that \n          Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of, as are followers of \n          most other world religions. \n           \n               First, Jesus Christ was NOT unique, John 3:16 NOTWITH-\n          STANDING.  There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master \n          (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES, \n          a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and \n          after the life of Jesus. \n    \n               The followers of some of these Masters founded the \n          world's major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of \n          their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added \n          THREATS of \"ETERNAL DAMNATION\" in Hell, and DELETED the \n          teaching of REincarnation. \n       \n               Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular \n          Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is \n          NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively \n          few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY \n          alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE \n          UNIVERSES.)                             \n\n               Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and \n          pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from \n          their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed \n          themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly \n          MANUFACTURED by the Romans. \n      \n               And emotional \"feelings\" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING \n          indicator for religious validity. \n    \n               These things are similarly true for followers of most \n          other major world religions, including Islam. \n     \n               Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune \n          His Initiates into the \"AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\" or \"SOUND \n          CURRENT\", (referred to as \"THE WORD\" in John 1:1-5, and as \n          \"The River of Life\" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally \n          guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they \n          are still connected to their living physical bodies by a \n          \"silver cord\". \n    \n               True Salvation, which completes a Soul's cycles of \n          REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved \n          only by reaching at least the \"SOUL PLANE\", which is five \n          levels or universes above the physical universe, and this \n          canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine \n          Master. \n    \n               One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri \n          Harold Klemp, the Living \"Eck\" Master or \"Mahanta\" for the \n          \"Eckankar\" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis, \n          (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427). \n    \n               Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now \n          living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the \"Sant \n          Mat\" organization. \n      \n               One of the classic books on this subject is \"THE PATH OF \n          THE MASTERS\" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA  \n          90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian \n          and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India \n          studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of \n          that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji. \n    \n               Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored \n          by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in \n          most public and university libraries and some book stores, or \n          obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book \"ECKANKAR--THE \n          KEY TO SECRET WORLDS\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER \n          classic. \n    \n               Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with \n          the \"Anti-Christ\", which is or was to be a temporary world \n          dictator during the so-called \"last days\".  But the Masters \n          don't ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as \n          Jesus was. \n    \n               People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or \n          other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will \n          CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the \n          Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they \n          finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine \n          Master. \n    \n          \n    \n          RE-INCARNATION\n          \n               The book \"HERE AND HEREAFTER\", by Ruth Montgomery, \n          describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation \n          as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past \n          lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes \n          makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist], \n          SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of \n          whom can identify their most recent previous relatives, \n          homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-\n          ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-\n          ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-\n          ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS \n          FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the \n          Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How \n          can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED \n          BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the \"KING JAMES VERSION\".  Later \n          versions are PER-VERSIONS! ] \n          \n               Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc., \n          typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES.  For example, \n          a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually \n          results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.  \n          And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to \n          another person being met for the first time in THIS life, \n          because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS \n          INCARNATION. \n\n               The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF \n          KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would \n          behave much better toward each other if they knew that their \n          actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the \n          future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION! \n\n\n\n          \"2nd COMINGS\"\n\n               If a Divine Master physically dies (\"translates\") \n          before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that \n          Initiate physically dies (\"translates\"), the Master will meet \n          him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul \n          Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd \n          Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that \n          happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still \n          waiting for Jesus' \"2nd Coming\" are WAITING IN VAIN. \n    \n          \n          \n          PLANES OF EXISTENCE\n\n               The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN \n          major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the \n          Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric \n          Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane), \n          the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The \n          Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from \n          the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the \n          Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes. \n    \n               It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological \n          influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See \n          the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without \n          an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between \n          the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane. \n    \n               The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a \n          sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called \"Hades\", and the \n          Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there \n          LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some \n          kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a \n          THREATENING manner.  The Christian \"Heaven\" is located \n          elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there \n          for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth. \n          \n          \n          \n          SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH\n\n               The Christian religion demands of its followers an \n          extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more \n          than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING). \n       \n               If a person is not HEARING some form of the \"SOUND \n          CURRENT\" (\"THE WORD\", \"THE BANI\", \"THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\"), \n          then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL \n          CONTINUE. \n    \n               The \"SOUND CURRENT\" manifests differently for different \n          Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on \n          the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a \n          flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.  In Eckankar, \n          Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as \n          a Member.  This and other experiences (such as \"SOUL TRAVEL\") \n          REPLACE blind faith. \n    \n\n\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (3 books, 2 addresses). \n\n\n\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \n          IMPORTANT Information is ENCOURAGED. \n", "label": 19}

{"text": "\nMy wifes uncle was a 30+ level mason.  He let me look at some of the books\n(which after his death his \"brothers\" came over and took from his greiving\nwidow before his body had even cooled).  Don't tell me you don't worship\nOsiris.  You must not be past your 20th level.  You should read Wilkinson's\nEgyptians and how he shows this Egyptian religion paralleling his own British\nMasonry.  There is a man here at this laboratory who is a 33 degree black\nmason.  I've talked with him, though much he likes to hide (\"mystery\"). \nSpecial handshakes and all.  When he first started trying to \"evangelize\" me,\nhe told me all kinds on special this, and special that.  Here is truely a\n\"mystery\" religion.  THere is the public side with motorcyle mania and\nchildrens hospitals and then there is the priviate side that only the highest\ndegree mason every learns of.\nI haven't read it, but the literature that is offered by the silver haired\napologist (can't remember his name) on TV, didn't exactly come to this same\nconclusion.  \n\n\"Khons, the son of the great goddess-mother, seems to have been gernaerally\nrepresented as a full-grown god. The Babylonian divinity was also represented\nvery frequently in Egupt in the very same wayas in the land of his nativity\n-i.e. as a child in his mother's arems.  THis was the way in which Osiris, 'the\nson, the husband of his mother,' was often exhibited, and what we learn of this\ngod, equally as in the case of Khonso, shows that in his original he was none\nother than Nimrod.  It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was\noriginally founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother,\nor wife of Osiris.  But what could have led to the union of a Masonic body with\nthese Mysteries, had they not had particular reference to architecture, and had\nthe god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success in\nperfecting the arts of fortification and building?  Now, if such were the case,\nconsidering the relation in which, as we have already seen, Egypt stood to\nBabylon, who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of the\nMasonic art?  The strong presumption is, that Nimrod must have been the man. \nHe was the first that gained faim in this way.  As the child of the Babylonian\ngoddess-mother, he was worshipped in the character of Ala mahozim, 'The God of\nFortification.'  Osiris, the child of the Egyptian Modonna, was equally\ncelebrated as 'the strong chief of the buildings.'  THis strong chief of the\nbuildings was origninally worshipped in Egypt with every physicall\ncharacteristic of Nimrod.  I have already noticed the fact that Nimrod, as the\nson of Cush, was a negro.  Now, there was a tradition in Egypt, recorded by\nPlutarch, that 'Osiris was black'.......\"  Hislop\n\nIt was like a cold slap to my face, when my wifes uncle brought out his\ncerimonial dress and it was leopard skin.  I mean real leopard skin.   He told\nme that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin.  (The reason that he\nstarted telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of months\nto live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in Christ and he immediately\nrepented from 'mysteries' of the lodge!)\n\nNimr-rod from Nimr, a \"leopard,\" and rada or rad \"To subdue.\"  It is a\nuniversal principle in all idolatries, that the high priest wears the insignia\nof the god he serves.  Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of\nsome leopard.  It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show, or\nshould I say hide, this representation.  They, however, worshipped the \"spotted\ncow\".\n\nI'll stand by my statements.  Masonry is of the \"mystery\" religions that all\nfind their source in Babylon, the great harlot. Sorry Peter,  I do not mean to\nbe a \"cold slap to the face\" but there is to much evidence to the contrary that\nMasonry doesn't find its origins in Egypt.  Of the Masons I have personally\ntalked to, all refered to Egypt as their origin.  Why are you now separating\nyourself from this which not many years ago, was freely admitted?", "label": 15}

{"text": "\n\n\n< rest deleted >\n\nAs a followup to my post let me add that:\n\nI'm not really a Windows or Windows NT user, so please excuse my ignorance.\nHowever, I'm a developer at SAS Institute, and one component of the\napplication that I support is the ability to submit a (SAS) batch job from\nwithin an interactive SAS session.  The user site can enter their\nsite-specific \"batch profile\" into a dataset within our product, specifying\nthe pathname to the SAS executable, specifying site specific SAS options,\netc.  At run time certain variables are resolved, and the resolved file is\nwritten to an external ascii file.  Then I exit to the operating system and\nrun the job asynchronously, returning to the interactive session as soon as\nthe job is submitted.  The batch job then runs concurrently with the\ninteractive session.\n\nAs currently designed, the internal dataset has a record length of 80\ncharacters.  But, to run the batch job, the command to reinvoke SAS in\nbatch mode requires more than 80 characters.  Up til NT this has not been a\nproblem, since every job control/shell language up til NT (eg.\nMVS/CMS/VMS/UNIX/OS2) had a way to escape the CR/LF and enter a single\ncommand across multiple lines (OS/2 via their REXX language, which is\n*STANDARD* with OS/2).\n\nThe gist of all this is, since this application is for end-users, not\nwithin my company, I have to try to develop this process using native NT.\nSince my first posting I've learned that there are several third party\ncompanies that provide alternative script languages for Windows/Windows NT.\nAnd I'm sure a company that licenses our product would use that alternative\nscript language if they had it, but I can't develop under the assumption\nthat they have anything other than what comes with NT.\n\nI saw another post on this list (the subject was something like \"Is vi\navailable for Windows?\") in which someone said that vi, make, awk, and\n***ksh*** was available with Microsoft TOOLKIT.  What is that product?  Is\nit a separate product or part of Windows?  ksh would do what I need if I\ncould count on it at all NT sites.\n\nOne last question:  I've heard that NT has remote processing capabilities,\ni.e. I could shove this batch job off to a server machine and have it run\nthere.  If these are native NT commands rather than network specific\ncommands, this would also help me improve this process.  If you can comment\non these commands, I would appreciate it.\n\nThanks again for the help,\n\n--\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScott Bass                           |  SAS Institute Inc.\nIntegrated Systems, A216, x6975      |  SAS Campus Drive, Cary, NC  27513-2414\nsasswb@k2.unx.sas.com                |  (919) 677-8001 x6975", "label": 2}

{"text": "This is an invitation to send articles to the Informatica magazine.\nThe first fully international issue has been published and echoes \nare quite favourable. For any information, contact (matjaz.gams@ijs.si). \n\nDear Colleague,                                        April 25, 1993\n\nNumber 1 of volume 17 of Informatica is now out of print and some of you \nwill receive it in a week or so. As you will see, the journal is structured\nin the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page\n-- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the edited\npart of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan for\nknowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100);\nand news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned to\ngive you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the\njournal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views\ninto the discourse.\n   A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This page\nexpresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems\nwithin the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other\nconcerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences,\nmind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology \n(e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this\npage for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get\nsuggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express\ntheir strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the\narea in question.\n   On the second page of each Number an editor's profile is published.\nThe aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional \nachievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on\none side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which\neditors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story should\nbe instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the \nunderstanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.\n   The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to have\na stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particular\nnumber can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situation\nright now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your\ncolleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to the\ncontemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated.\nA special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh\nideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.\n   Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.)\nand particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome.\nYou can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail.\nOn the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annual\nreports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishing\nin Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest.\n   E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect.\nYou can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even complete\npapers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We received\nseveral final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US,\nRussia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typed\ntexts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contact\nperson (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal. So,\nyou will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerning\nour common interest and job.\n\nAt the end, please do not forget: we need your cooperation and help in\nevery mentioned respect. The aim of Informatica is to open various\npossibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and \nphilosophical orientations as well as those coming up, still unrevealed,\nand on the way to become significant. Please, do not apprehend to give\nproposals, suggestions, and, certainly, contributions via the e-mail\nand by other means.\n\nSincerely yours,", "label": 1}

{"text": "The following article by columnist Mike Royko is his humorous commentary\non some of the public's perception of doctors and their salaries.\nI hope some of you will find it as amusing as I did.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n[Reprinted w/o permission]\n\n\n\"There's no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors' salaries\"\n\nBy Mike Royko\nTribune Media Services\n\n\n     On a stupidity scale, a recent poll about doctors' earnings \nis right up there.  It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10.\n     It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called \nFamilies USA.\n      The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe \nthat doctors make too much money.\n     The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for \nphysicians.  Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be \nOK.\n     How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid.\n     Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentment \nand envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign \nand are still simmering.\n     You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that \nearns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majority \nof Americans don't make those bucks,  they assume that those  who \ndo are stealing it from them.\n     Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down,  but don't  kid  yourself.  \nKarl Marx lives.\n     It's also stupid because it didn't ask key  questions,  such \nas:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to \nbecome a physician?\n     If those polled said no,  they didn't know, then they should \nhave  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers,  they \nshould have been dropped.   What good are their views on how much \na doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a \ndoctor?\n     Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  \"How \nmuch  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellent \ngrades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order \nto (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking \ncourses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and \nmaintain a 3.5 average or better,  and (c) spend four more  years \nof  grinding study in medical school,  with the third and  fourth \nyears in clinical training,  working 80 to 100 hours a week,  and \n(d) spend another year as a low-pay,  hard-work intern,  and  (e) \nput  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training, \ndepending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100,000  in \ndebt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60 \nhours  a week,  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  or \nmore until they retire or fall over?\"\n     As  you have probably guessed by now,  I  have  considerably \nmore  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  and \nClinton,  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have \ncalled together to remake America's health care.\n     Based  on what doctors contribute to society,  they are  far \nmore useful than the power-happy,  ego-tripping, program-spewing, \nsocial tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is \nto health what Clinton's first budget is to frugality.\n     But propaganda works.   And,  as the stupid poll  indicates, \nmany Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the \nmajor cause of high medical costs.\n     Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be.  \nAmericans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible for \nour longevity--lawyers,  Congress, or the guy flipping burgers in \na McDonald's?\n     And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become \na  nation  of  self-indulgent,   lard-butted,   TV-gaping   couch \ncabbages.\n     Ah,  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  or \nSuper  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   But \ninstead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain, \n     \"Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest \nproblems we have.   That problem is you, my fellow American. Yes, \nyou,  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods;  many  of  you \nguzzling  too  much hooch;  still puffing away at $2.50  a  pack; \ngetting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  the \nmicrowave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into \nthe  world;  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshot \nvictims;  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  disease \nwhile blaming the world for not finding an instant cure.\n     \"You  and  your habits,  not the  doctors,  are  the  single \nbiggest  health  problem in this country.   If  anything,  it  is \namazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do.\n     \"In fact,  I don't understand how they can stand looking  at \nyour blubbery bods all day.\n     \"So as your president,  I call upon you to stop whining  and \nstart living cleanly.   Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy-\ngreasy with double fries.  Do as I say, not as I do.\"\n     But  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid, \nthere is another solution: Don't use them.\n     That's right.   You don't feel well?   Then try one of those \nspine poppers,  needle twirlers, or have Rev. Bubba lay his hands \nupon your head and declare you fit.\n     Or  there is the do-it-yourself approach.   You  have  chest \npains?   Then sit in front of a mirror,  make a slit here, a slit \nthere, and pop in a couple of valves.\n     You're  going to have a kid?   Why throw your money at  that \noverpaid  sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger  house \nthan  you  will  ever  have  (while  paying  more  in  taxes  and \nmalpractice insurance than you will ever earn)?\n     Just have the kid the old-fashioned way.   Squat and do  it.  \nAnd if it survives,  you can go to the library and find a book on \nhow to give it its shots.\n     By  the  way,  has  anyone  ever done a  poll  on  how  much \npollsters should earn?\n\n\nRoyko  is  a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for  Tribune  Media \nServices.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\n", "label": 13}

The parts are\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\nWe don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.\n\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \nevery 21 days.\n\n\nContents:\n\n* What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?\n* Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?\n* How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?\n\n\n* What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?\n\n  Read news.announce.newusers and news.answers for a few weeks. Always\n  make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it.\n  You'll be amazed how often the same question can be asked in the same\n  newsgroup. After a month you'll have a much better sense of what the\n  readers want to see.\n\n* Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?\n\n  No. In fact some newsgroups (notably misc.legal.computing) were\n  created exactly so that political questions like ``Should RSA be\n  patented?'' don't get in the way of technical discussions. Many\n  sci.crypt readers also read misc.legal.computing, comp.org.eff.talk,\n  comp.patents, sci.math, comp.compression, et al.; for the benefit of\n  people who don't care about those other topics, try to put your\n  postings in the right group.\n\n  Questions about microfilm and smuggling and other non-cryptographic\n  ``spy stuff'' don't belong in sci.crypt either.\n\n* How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?\n\n  ``I just came up with this neat method of encryption. Here's some\n  ciphertext: FHDSIJOYW^&%$*#@OGBUJHKFSYUIRE. Is it strong?'' Without a\n  doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on sci.crypt.\n\n  If you have come up with an encryption scheme, providing some\n  ciphertext from it is not adequate. Nobody has ever been impressed by\n  random gibberish. Any new algorithm should be secure even if the\n  opponent knows the full algorithm (including how any message key is\n  distributed) and only the private key is kept secret. There are some\n  systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts\n  and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm, but\n  this is a time-consuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most\n  sci.crypt readers won't bother with.\n\n  So what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme? First of all,\n  find out if it's really new. Look through this FAQ for references and\n  related methods. Familiarize yourself with the literature and the\n  introductory textbooks.\n\n  When you can appreciate how your cryptosystem fits into the world at\n  large, try to break it yourself! You shouldn't waste the time of tens\n  of thousands of readers asking a question which you could have easily\n  answered on your own.\n\n  If you really think your system is secure, and you want to get some\n  reassurance from experts, you might try posting full details of your\n  system, including working code and a solid theoretical explanation, to\n  sci.crypt. (Keep in mind that the export of cryptography is regulated\n  in some areas.)\n\n  If you're lucky an expert might take some interest in what you posted.\n  You can encourage this by offering cash rewards---for instance, noted\n  cryptographer Ralph Merkle is offering $1000 to anyone who can break\n  Snefru-4---but there are no guarantees. If you don't have enough\n  experience, then most likely any experts who look at your system will\n  be able to find a flaw. If this happens, it's your responsibility to\n  consider the flaw and learn from it, rather than just add one more\n  layer of complication and come back for another round.\n\n  A different way to get your cryptosystem reviewed is to have the NSA\n  look at it. A full discussion of this procedure is outside the scope\n  of this FAQ.", "label": 11}

Whilst I\nhave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you\nshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I\nwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some\nrelevant books are listed in a companion article.\n\nTo provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article\nas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the\nquestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped\nup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other\nfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.\n\nPlease note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions\nposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect\nquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians\nwho proselytize on alt.atheism.\n\nSo when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as\nChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine\nbeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it\nmay not.\n\n\"What is atheism?\"\n\nAtheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.\nSome atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is\noften referred to as the \"weak atheist\" position, and the latter as \"strong\natheism\".\n\nIt is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \"Weak\natheism\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \"Strong\natheism\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not\nfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \"strong atheists\".\n\nSome atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their\natheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making\nflat-out denials.\n\n\"But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?\"\n\nDefinitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe\nit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to\nbelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or\nnot.  Which brings us to agnosticism.\n\n\"What is agnosticism then?\"\n\nThe term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the\nMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who\ndisclaimed (\"strong\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things\nmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.\n\nThus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for\nsure whether God exists.\n\nWords are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that\nyou can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact\nthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people\nuse agnosticism to mean \"weak atheism\", and use the word \"atheism\" only when\nreferring to \"strong atheism\".\n\nBeware also that because the word \"atheist\" has so many shades of meaning, it\nis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for\nsure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn't\nthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out\nabout the universe.\n\n\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\"\n\nThere are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a\nparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.\n\nMany atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions\nis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that\nsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they\nsee no evidence that God exists.\n\n\"But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\"\n\nThere are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is\nquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than\nall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects\nobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly\nwell-defined is a matter for debate.\n\nHowever, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably\nimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of\nGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to\nshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.\n\nIf on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in\nquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid\nmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing\nmight be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search is\noften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest\nprimes, because we can prove that they don't exist.\n\nTherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist\nunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of\nthe time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusively\nprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.\n\nTo assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be\ntested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to\nprove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by\ndefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.\n\nThose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God\nexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover\nvarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it\nmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be\npossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious\nbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described\nby any present-day religion exists.\n\nIn practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very\nclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different\nthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of\nGod are not really applicable.\n\n\"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?\"\n\nIf God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction\nmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be\ndetectable.\n\nIf God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he\ndoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue\nthat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no\nimportance whether he exists or not.\n\nIf the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.\nSurely he should still be detectable today?\n\nNote that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically\nverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some\neffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him\nfrom all the other things that don't exist?\n\n\"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but\n isn't it still a religious belief?\"\n\nOne of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is \"the\nredefinition game\".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:\n\nPerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out\nthat it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the\nstatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He\nthen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to\nit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an \"agreed fact\", but\nuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure\nredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen\nto be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.\n\nThe point of this digression is that the answer to the question \"Isn't\natheism a religious belief?\" depends crucially upon what is meant by\n\"religious\".  \"Religion\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman\ncontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and\nworship.\n\n[ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not\n  \"religion\" according to such a definition. ]\n\nAtheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it\ncategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of\n\"religious\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of\nhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as \"religious\" as well -- such as\nscience, politics, and watching TV.\n\n\"OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is\n still just an act of faith, like religion is?\"\n\nFirstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one\nactually believes in.\n\nSecondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to\nmake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists\ntry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to\nquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.\n\nScience has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally\nassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are\nthe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called\n\"acts of faith\", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on\nacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.\n\nFaith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.\nAccording to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of\nfaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as\nreligious followers when claiming that something is \"certain\".  This is not a\ngeneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to\nstate with certainty that the universe exists.\n\nFaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.\nSceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheism\nhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, as\neven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or\nthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.\n\n\"If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?\"\n\nIt is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either \"for\" or\n\"against\", \"friend\" or \"enemy\".  The truth is not so clear-cut.\n\nAtheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,\nit can be said to be \"anti-religion\".  However, when religious believers\nspeak of atheists being \"anti-religious\" they usually mean that the atheists\nhave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.\n\nThis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.\nAtheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.\n\nMost atheists take a \"live and let live\" attitude.  Unless questioned, they\nwill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of\ncourse, this may be in part because atheism is not \"socially acceptable\" in\nmany countries.\n\nA few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to \"convert\" others\nwhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little\nimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.\n\n(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation\nof church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to\nworship as they wished.  The institution of \"state atheism\" came about when\nStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in\norder to gain complete power over the population.)\n\nSome atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see\nreligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,\nthe government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that\nchurch and state should remain separate.\n\n\"But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,\n surely that's the same as state atheism?\"\n\nThe principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall\nnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it\nmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of\nanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in\nnature.\n\nReligions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For\nexample, religious believers have historically been responsible for\nencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations\ncampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as\nreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,\nand so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists\nare quite happy to see them have their say.\n\n\"What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people\n pray?\"\n\nBecause people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things\nthat those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in\nschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they\nneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means\nthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be\nacceptable to all those present at any public event.\n\nAlso, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable\nto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other\nmotives.\n\n\"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about\n atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't\n atheists object to the religious charities?\"\n\nThere are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can\ncontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for\nthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work\nfor charities founded on a theistic basis.\n\nMost atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about in\nconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday\nmatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to say\nself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set\nof religious beliefs.\n\nTo \"weak\" atheists, building a hospital to say \"I do not believe in God\" is a\nrather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say \"Today is not my\nbirthday\".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.\n\n\"You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against\n one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?\"\n\nPerhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to\nforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people\nchoose to call themselves atheists.\n\nIt's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a\nbacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the\nother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the\nexpectations of others.\n\nOn the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion are\nbacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go\nalong with a group rather than act or think independently.\n\n\"How do atheists differ from religious people?\"\n\nThey don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.\n\nAtheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a\nVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,\nthey may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many\nBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy\nof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!\n\nWhoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without\nrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and\nappearance.\n\n\"Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?\"\n\nThat depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course\natheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when one\ntalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (\"right\") and unacceptable\n(\"wrong\") behaviour within society.\n\nHumans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must\nco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most\natheists from \"anti-social\" or \"immoral\" behaviour, purely for the purposes\nof self-preservation.\n\nMany atheists behave in a \"moral\" or \"compassionate\" way simply because they\nfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care\nwhat happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.\n\nNaturally, there are some people who behave \"immorally\" and try to use\natheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who\nbehave \"immorally\" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their\nactions.  For example:\n\n  \"Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ\n   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was\n   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited\n   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive\n   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,\n   be honor and glory forever and ever.\"\n\nThe above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992\nby Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,\nWisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a\nreligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?\n\n   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior\n   deteriorated after \"born again\" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents\n   said they had driven intoxicated before being \"born again,\" 12% had done\n   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before\n   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex\n   before salvation; 5% after.\n                                [\"Freethought Today\", September 1991, p. 12.]\n\nSo it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral\nbehaviour.\n\n\"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?\"\n\nIf you mean \"Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?\", then the\nanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality\nwhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.\n\nIf you mean \"Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?\", then the answer\nis no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person\nwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same \"moral rules\" as theists,\nbut for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by\nhumans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, rather\nthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.\n\n\"Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?\"\n\nA study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the\natheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for\nthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible\nwith what they observed around them.\n\nAtheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are\nunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time\nstudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have\nmade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.\n\nThis decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that\nindividual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice\nof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only\nchoice that person can honestly make.\n\n\"But don't atheists want to believe in God?\"\n\nAtheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many\nof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the\n\"Big Brother\" figure might be.\n\nSome atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should\none believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of\nsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to\nbelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.\n\n\"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are\n unwilling in their souls to see!\"\n\nMany, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained\nabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God\nexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.\n\nOf course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that\nall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.\nComments such as \"Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly\"\nare likely to be viewed as patronizing.\n\nCertainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is\nvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are\nbeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not\nwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is\nfutile.\n\n\"Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?\"\n\nMany atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives\nmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives\ncount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other\npeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to\npolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.\n\nIt is a natural human tendency to look for \"meaning\" or \"purpose\" in random\nevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that \"life\" is the sort of thing\nthat has a \"meaning\".\n\nTo put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually\na sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking \"What is the\nmeaning of life?\" is as silly as asking \"What is the meaning of a cup of\ncoffee?\".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.\n\n\"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?\"\n\nThere are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.\nOr on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.\n\nThat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so\nwhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or\nshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?\n\nIn the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are\nunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because\nit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider\nthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's just\nhard luck.\n\n\"Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?\"\n\nThe short answer is \"No, do you?\"\n\nMany atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many\narguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have\nfound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.\n\nThousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof of\nthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely\nto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.\n\n\"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments\n apply?\"\n\nNo, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is\nthe sceptical \"default position\" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism\nis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.\n\nAtheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs\nbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,\nbut to everyone else.\n\n\"What sort of harm?\"\n\nReligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's not\njust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;\nthink of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.\nImagine how that effort could be better spent.\n\nMany theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances\nof ill people being \"healed\" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines\nprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died\nbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.\n\nIt is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- and\ncondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many\nthird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.\n\nReligious believers have been known to murder their children rather than\nallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different\nreligion.\n\n\"Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some\n sort of excuse.\"\n\nWhat makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hard\nto tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all\nconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight\nand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REAL\nChristian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like the\nCatholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?\n\nIn the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who\ncalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his\nactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians\nare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if\nthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't be\nmuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he have\nmade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs\naren't a perversion of what your God intended?\n\nIf there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why\nshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?\nSorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered\nothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a\nChristian.\n\n\"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since\n nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely\n that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.\"\n\nThat does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,\npositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much\nharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns\ndon't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.\n\nIt is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than\nit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, \"weak\" atheists\nwould argue that asserting nothing is better still.\n\n\"Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?\"\n\nUnfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how \"correct\"\nit is, or whether it \"works\"; consider how many people believe in astrology,\ngraphology, and other pseudo-sciences.\n\nMany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in\ngods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the\npeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.\n\nOf course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,\nwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when\nthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started\nas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other\npurposes as well.\n\n\"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say\n something?\"\n\nNot really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it's\nworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of\nconcept of God in the Christian sense.\n\nOf course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it's\nrather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.\n\n\"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded\n that God exists?\"\n\nFor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who\ndoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is\nnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to\nrealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the\nsame way that theists view their religious leaders.\n\nA famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but\nwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many\nrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on\nsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.\n\n\"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates\n nothing?\"\n\nNot entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has\nproperties which have helped it so spread so far.\n\nThe theory of memetics talks of \"memes\" -- sets of ideas which can propagate\nthemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view\nreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by\nencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by\ndiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure\nto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some\nreligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by\nother memes.\n\nOf course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with\nsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of\nthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing\nbecause of the number of people who have caught it.\n\n\"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important\n messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?\"\n\nThere are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a\nfew of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some\nreligions.\n\n   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.\n\n   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.\n\n   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to\n   find it.\n\n   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.\n\n   Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.\n\n   It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change\n   yourself.\n\n   Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.\n\n   If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.\n\n   Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.\n\nand finally (and most importantly):\n\n   All beliefs should be open to question.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this article.\n\n\nmathew\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: 2.2\n\niQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO\n7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6/9bV9okE/q\nnihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmP\nq0Z4hSSPpAU=\n=q2V5\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----", "label": 0}

The serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points,\nnot to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say.\nThe non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish.\n\nI personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames.\nThe first does trade ``quality,'' in the sense you mention, for heat.\nThis has a certain surprise value and if done correctly, which I\ncontend was done above, is reasonably entertaining.  While it is true that\nthe flame I posted does not mention anyone's habitual velocity, friends,\ndinner, or entertainment, it says what it needs to with the appropriate\nflair and it is short.  The weakness of this type of flame is actually\nthat it can easily be taken too far, at which point it becomes trite and\nboring.  (Witness the Infante thread recently....)\n\nThe other type of flame, which you seem to be glorifying above, has\na few weaknesses as well.  In the first place, it can get verbose and \ntedious in the extreme, particularly if the reader does not already strongly\nidentify with one side or the other.  In the second, discussing someone's\npersonal qualities, habits, and so forth can quickly become libelous.\n(Or is that slanderous?  I can never remember the difference.)  This leads\nto a proliferation of lawyers, which is widely regarded as a BAD THING.\nFinally, introducing polysyllabic words is problematic.  I can't haul my\nbig dic. around on my bike, and it would be bad form to use a word which\nactually turned out to have a meaning, especially one which ran counter\nto my use and flamage in general.\n\nIn summary, Blaine, your score for that flame is incorrect.  While it may\nbe the wunder-flame, the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily\nweaknesses, and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor\napplicable.

The revolver times\nwere pretty close, but some of the times with the S&W were in minutes, or\nthe person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey.\n\n\tYou don't often see Colt 45 autos issued due to the light trigger\nwhich can be accidentally fired in a stress situation, opening the issuing\ncity,county, etc.. to lawsuits, bad press, etc..\n\n\tOf course any problem can be overcome with enough training, but\nsuch training is not always available to budget crunched departments.  I\nknow if I were a Cop I would want something like a S&W just for the off\nchance of the gun getting taken away.  The safety doesn't guarantee that\n'Mr. Bad' won't figure it out and shoot me, but it could buy enough time\nto draw a second gun and shoot 'Mr. Bad' before it's too late.\n\n\tDon't think I am too biassed here just because I have had 3 Glocks\nin my possession at one time, because I have had a .45 as well.  In fact,\nit was my first handgun.  Remember, the ultimate 'safety' is YOU the\noperator, and no safety is going to stop an negligent discharge (note I\ndon't say accidental) if you break the rules of gun handling.\n\n\tAs per the part of being light weight and looking cool, I agree\n100%.  I wouldn't rule it out as a first purchase.  ", "label": 16}

The keywords `Monthly Posting'\nwill always appear to make killing this article easy for users of\nnewsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autos\ngroups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don't\nunderstand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at\nleast for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, please\nsubscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the\ndocumentation provided there.\n\nIntroduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:\n\nrec.autos.tech\n\nis intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design,\nconstruction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely\ninappropriate, especially For Sale ads.\n\nrec.autos.sport\n\nis intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving\nautomobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply\nto competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints,\nspectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are\nlargely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are\ninappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment.\nDiscussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid\nadvocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)\n\nrec.autos.driving\n\nis intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles.\nAlso, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert\nyour pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.\n\nrec.autos.vw\n\nis intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership\nof automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis,\nSeats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing\nlist was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence\nof this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many\ndifferent marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be\ncreated on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as\na mailing list.\n\nrec.audio.car\n\nis not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however,\nthe correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and\nso is mentioned here.\n\nrec.autos.antique\n\nis intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years\nold, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)\n\nalt.hotrod\n\nis not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the\nrec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing\nlist, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing\nperformance vehicles.\n\nalt.autos.rod-n-custom\n\nalso not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar\nAmerican hobby of customizing older cars.\n\nalt.autos.karting\n\nfor the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.\n\nrec.autos\n\nis intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.\n\n\nCrossposting:\n\nCrossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on\nthe Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear\nin all of the newsgroups listed.\n\nCrossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on\nUsenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is\nappropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular\naudience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector\narticles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are\nalmost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact\nthat you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or\nrec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.\n\nCrossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually\ninappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is\ntruly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To:\nto point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.\n\nCrossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in\nparticular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of\nradar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.\n\nMost readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about\nthe police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in\nrec.autos.\n\nIt is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of\narticles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to\nmisc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these\nthree.  The life you save may be your own.\n\nDistribution:\n\nThere is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to\n(partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution\nfield.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve\nas a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.\n\nThe distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing, \nthe Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia,\nNew Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the\nfollowing hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article\nheaders, and on article content.\n\n1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford\nMavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in\neither place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange\nreason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)\n\n2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which\nyour car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences\nbetween a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise,\nall 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel\ninjection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These\ndifferences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear.\nFailure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant\nspread of misinformation.\n\n3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting;\nin the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas\nEurope is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition\nof this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used\nabbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos\nreaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.\n\n4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when\npossible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can\n(canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state\nabbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted\nto send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put\n\"ny,nj\" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated\nvalues are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so\nyou should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely\nto be supported in your area.\n\nThe Dangers of Overgeneralization:\n\nTo amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article:\nBe wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is\ntrue for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a\n1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly\ndifferent from those in Idaho.\n\nThe Need for Adequate Specification:\n\nWhen you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information;\ne.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year,\nmodel, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be\nquite useless.\n\n\nConcerning Lemons:\n\nAt one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or\ntwo; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time by\nannouncing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all\n`brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from\nthe `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they\ncause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful\ninformation.\n\n\nConcerning Flames:\n\nAs much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most\nlikely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how\nto deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section\nof this posting):\n\nIf you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a\nminute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, and\nyou'll get exactly what you deserve.\n\nIf you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can\ncite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe\nbald, unsupported assertions.\n\nBe careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.\n\n\nAsking the Question:\n\nIt is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please\nsend email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea to\nend the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest\nI'll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses\nto this request'.\n\nAnswering the Question:\n\nIf someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang.\nEither be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on\ndefending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time --\nit's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly\naddress the original question.  In general, don't post in order to see\nyour words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and\nself-righteous.\n\n\nStale and/or Inflammatory Topics:\n\nCertain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion of\nthem is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings\nabout them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them\nignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is\ndifficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some\nof these topics include the following:\n\n1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con\n\n2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of\n    radar detectors.\n\n3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.\n\n4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why\n    rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue\n    about what constitutes a `sports car'.)\n\n5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's\n    right to own and operate a radar detector\n\n6)  `Buy American' discussions\n\n7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates\n\n8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible\n\n9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?\n      [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the\n          commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.\n          Until then, please don't waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw]\n\n\n\nPlease direct comments and suggestions about this article to:\n\n     welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com", "label": 7}

{"text": "Dean Velasco quoted a letter from James M Stowell, president of\nMoody Bible Institute:\n\n\n\nThere has been a lot of discussion, but so far nobody seems to have hit on\nexactly what the criticism of \"arrogance\" is aimed at.\n\nThe arrogance being attacked is that we \"think we are the only ones who know\nwhat the absolutes are\".  In short, many evangelicals claim that they are\ninfallible on the matter of religious texts.\n\nIn particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you can\nthink of epistemology as \"how do you know?\"  That question, it turns out, is\na very troubling one.\n\nThe problem with `absolute certainty' is that, at the bottom, at least some of\nthe thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain that\neverything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to\ndiscover a source of truth is in question.\n\nAnd that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of\nauthority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.\n\n\nLet's take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictional\nInerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea of\nPapal Infallibility, too.)\n\nZeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, and\nseveral other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (and\npossibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of Absolute\nTruth.\n\nHe may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct.\nHis conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made\nmistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  His\nconclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have made\nmistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made\nmistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)\n\nEverything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that\nhappened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter what\nhe does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own\ninfallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his own\nreasoning, that belief cannot be considered \"absolutely certain\".\n\nZeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief\nis only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he can\nsay that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.\n\nAny belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on\nyour own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infallible\nthinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.\n\n\nThis is easy to demonstrate.  Let's go back to our shorthand method of doing\nepistemology: \"how do you know?\"  Imagine a hypothetical discussion:\n\n A: The Bible is a source of absolute truth.\n\n B: How do you know?\n\n A: I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church\n    teachings and came to this conclusion.\n\n B: How do you know you studied history correctly?\n\n A: Well, I double-checked everything.\n\n B: How do you know you double-checked correctly?\n\n A: Well, I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed.\n\n B: Just because some smart guy believes something that doesn't mean it is\n    true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly?\n\n A: ...\n\nAnd, as you see, B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say \"I\ncan't prove that there are no mistakes\" -- and as long as you may have made a\nmistake, then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.\n\nThere is no way out of the loop.\n\n\nThis is where the \"arrogance of Christians\" arises: many people believe\nthat their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the\ndoctrines of Christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they are\ninfallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.\n\nClaiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake, and that your thinking has led\nyou to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant.\n\n *\n\nPeople who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to\nfind _The Infallibility of the Church_, by George Salmon.  He is attacking\nthe idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well),\nbut the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible is\nknowably Inerrant.\n", "label": 15}
{"text": "\n\nTis' only a gleam in my eye at this point.  I have yet to chose a tracking \nmethod.

These are folks who\n   believe that baptism should be done with a formula mentioning only\n   Jesus, rather than Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  This may have\n   doctrinal implications, but as far as I know it does not mean that\n   these folks deny the existence or divinity of the Father.  I'm not the\n   right one to describe this theology, and in fact I think there may be\n   several, including what would classically be called monophysite or\n   Arian (two rather different views), as well as some who have beliefs\n   that are probably consistent with Trinitarian standards, but who won't\n   use Trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply\n   because it is not Biblical.  --clh]\n\nNot Biblical?  What then can they make of the end of Matthew?\n\n(28:18)And Jesus came and said to them, \"All authority in heaven and on\nearth has been given to me. (19)Go therefore and make disciples of all\nnations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and\nof the Holy Spirit, (20) and teaching them to obey everything that I\nhave commanded to you.  And remember, I am with you always, to the end\nof the age.\" {Other ancient authorities add *Amen*} [NRSV]\n\nThe notes give no sense that this is emended.  Do other texts\ncontradict this regarding Baptism?  Or is a misunderstanding of the\nTrinity the most likely explanation after all?\n\nBut maybe I simply misunderstand their views.  (Is anyone else out there\nforced to read this group with both a good Bible and an unabridged\ndictionary??  Christianity really is an education in itself.)\n\n--\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Arrgggghhhh.  When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian\nlanguage as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, things\nlike \"one essense and three persons\".  Obviously the three-fold\nbaptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use the\nterm \"three-fold\" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainly\nconsistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whose\nfull formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cent's.  It's unlikely\nthat Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine.\nIndeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do\nnot believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulae\noccurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism in\nthe name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as\nwell.)  This leaves us with sort of a problem: we're commanded in Mat.\nto baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,\nand in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus.\n\n\"Jesus only\" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider this\nconsistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name of\nthe Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  I'm not the right one to\nask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does not\nappear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way of\ndealing with the idiomatic phrase \"in the name of\".)\n\nThose who use the three-fold formula don't seem to have a standard\nanswer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus.\nI suspect that the most common explanation is to say that \"in the name\nof\" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the name\nof Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus'\nauthority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptism\nwith the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course there's a\ncertain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that we\ncould just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesn't require the specific\nthree-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes\nbaptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n\nOne might well suspect that in the early church, more than one\nbaptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus to\nbe the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great\ndamage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean that\nI think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one of\nthe few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize\nmutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in\nthe interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact that\nthose groups that actually use \"in the name of Jesus\" now do seem to\nhave in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as I've said before, I'm\nnot the one to explain what their doctrine is.", "label": 15}

{"text": "Hello src readers,\n\nAgain the misconception that Copts among other Oriental Orthodox\nChurches believe in Monophysitism pops up again. We had a discussion\nabout it a while ago. \n\n\nThen OFM comments :\n\n\nWith my appreciation to the moderator, I believe that further elaboration\nis needed. This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue\nof the Copt-Net Newsletter :\n\nUnder the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed\nto the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played\nleading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak\nabout the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the\nEcumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said\nthat the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their\ntime in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics\nstarted to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor\nMarcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St.\nDioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference\nwas clear: \"You have nothing to do with the Church.\"  These political motives\nbecame even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was\nunfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in\nmonophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only\none nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.\n\nThe Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was\nportrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant\nbelieving in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His\ndivinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His\nhumanity were united in one nature called \"the nature of the incarnate word\",\nwhich was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two\nnatures \"human\" and   \"divine\"  that are   united in   one \"without mingling,\nwithout confusion, and without alteration\" (from the  declaration of faith at\nthe end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures \"did not separate\nfor a moment or the twinkling of an eye\" (also from  the declaration of faith\nat the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).\n\nThe  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of\nChalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they\nwanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian,\nindependent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very\nstrict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the\nWestern Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal\nto be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn't  quite go the\nextra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic\nChurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile \"semantic\" differences between\nall  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th\nsuccessor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  \"To the  Coptic Church, faith is\nmore  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and\nterminology are of  little importance to us.\"  Throughout this  century,  the\nCoptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The\nCoptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has\nremained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a\nmember  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East\nCouncil of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the\nChristian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the\ntheological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and\nEvangelical Churches.\n\n[...]\n\nAs a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign\na common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism\nwas condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in\nMonophysitism.\n\nPeace,\n\nNabil\n\n          .-------------------------------------------------------------.\n         /  Nabil Ayoub                        ____/   __  /    ____/  /\n        /  Engine Research Center             /       /   /    /      /\n       /  Dept. of Mechanical Engineering    ___/    __  /    /      /\n      /  University of Wisconsin-Madison    /       /   |    /      /\n     /  Email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu  _____/ __/   _|  _____/  /\n    '-------------------------------------------------------------'\n\n[As I mentioned in a brief apology, the comment quoted above from me\nis confused.  I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As\nAndrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were\nactually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil\nexplains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered\nheretical probably aren't.\n\nChalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and\nAntiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable\nto moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree\nthat there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course\nof the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got\nrejected who didn't intend heresy, but simply used language that was\nnot understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have\njointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are\ngroups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This\nposting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also\na remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called\nmonophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called\nNestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius from\nwhat they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his\nheresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of\nthe Antiochene tradition.", "label": 15}

{"text": "First, I thank collectively all people who have given good answers\nto my questions. In my follow-up to Jason Smith's posting, I will\naddress some issues that have caused misunderstanding:\n\n\n\n\nYes, to some degree. There was an excellent discussion in sci.skeptic\non the nature of scientific work two weeks ago, I hope it did not\nescape your notice. \n\nThe correct word is 'likely'. There is no way to be sure our models and\ntheories are absolutely correct. Theories are backed up by evidence,\nbut not proved - no theory can be 'true' in a mathematical sense.\n\nHowever, theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of\nphenomena. It is extremely important to test whether theories can\n_predict_ something new or not yet observed. All successful theories\nscience has come up with have passed this test, including the Big\nBang theory of cosmic evolution, the theory of natural selection etc.\nIt does not mean they _must_ be correct, but they are not mere\n'best fits' for the data. \n\n\n\nWell, yes, if you want to _believe_ in them. This is not what science\nrequires - take a good look at the theory and the evidence, see if\nthe theory has made any successful predictions, and use your reason.\nDisbelievers are not punished. \n\n\nThis is what puzzles me - why do we need to have faith in _anything_?\nMy fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist - someone who is\nunable to believe, ie, fails to entertain any belief in God. \n\nYes, I know that one can't believe without God's help; Luther makes\nthis quite clear in his letter to Erasmus. I'm afraid this does not\nchange my situation. \n\n\n\n\n(deletions)\n\n\n\nNo, it is not, although it does look like one. This is a true dichotomy,\neither something exists, or nothing exists. If nothing exists, nobody\nwould ask why. If something exists, it is possible to ask why, but\nactually no existing being could give an answer. \n\nImagine, for a moment, that the nobodies in non-existence could also\nask: \"Why nothing exists?\" This is equivalent to my counter-question,\n\"why nothing exists in nothingness\". \n\nNow, \"why anything exists\" is equivalent to \"why something exists in\nsomethingness\".  _This_ is what I meant with my tautology, my apologies\nfor the poor wording in my previous post.\n\n\nI do indeed think there probably _is_ no reason for being, or existence,\nin general, for reasons I stated above. However, they will still\nleave open the question \"why this, and not that\", and this is where\ntheistic explanations come in.\n\nScience cannot give reasons for any _particular_ human being's existence.\n\n\nThis is a deep philosophical question - is determinism true, or not?\nAlso, is God deterministic or not? I tend to think this question has\nno meaning in His case. \n\nIf I am for a reason, I've yet failed to see what it would be. \nFrom our perspective, it looks like 'I' exist for truly random\nreasons. I just rolled two dice - why did I get 6 and 1? How can\nI believe there is any better reason for my existence?\n\n\nYes, I am satisfied with this reason, until I find something better.\nMy 15 years of Christianity were of no help in this respect, I have\nto admit, but I am patient.\n\n\n\nNo, it doesn't, but I think an existing God cannot know why He exists,\nfor an answer to this question is not knowable. Of course, this\nshould not be any obstacle to belief in His existence.\n\n\nIt is impossible to know unknowable things. However, the question \n\"why do I exist, in particular\" is _not_ an invalid question - this\nis not what I said. But from our perspective, it is impossible to\ntell, and I can't just believe in any given explanation instead of\nanother, especially since I found I was deluding myself. \n\n\nI think \"pre-existence\" is an oxymoron. There is no time 'outside' of\nthis spacetime (except in some other universe), and from that \nperspective, our universe never was. It exists only for those who\nare inside it. \n\n\nNo. The validity of the question has to be discussed separately; I think\nphilosophy is of great help here. What can be known, and what is not\nknowable?\n\n\nThis is a very good question. In trying to answer this, and numerous\nother questions that bothered me, I finally found nothing to base\nmy faith on. \n\nI think it would be honest if we all asked ourselves, \"why do I believe\"\nor \"why I don't believe\". \n\nPetri\n", "label": 15}

{"text": "\n\nra>   Robert, you keep making references to \"orthodox\" belief, and saying\nra> things like \"it is held that...\" (cf. \"Kermit\" thread).  On what\nra> exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call \"orthodox?\"\n\n     \"Orthodox\" is a compound word. It comes from 'orthos' (straight, true, \n     right) and from 'doxa' (opinion, doctrine, teaching). I use orthodox to \n     refer to 'right teaching.' Right teaching is derived from letting God \n     speak to us through the Bible. This can be from reading simple truths \n     in the Scriptures and by using the Bible to interpret the Bible.\n\nra> Who is that \"holds that\" Luke meant what you said he meant?\n\n     I think that it is apparent from reading the Scriptures that are\n     pertinent.\n\n     Luke 23:43 records Christ's promise to the repentant thief who hung on\n     an adjacent cross: \"Truly I say to you, today you will be with Me in\n     paradise.\" But was it not until later that Christ rose from the dead\n     and ascended to heaven? If Christ Himself was not in heaven until\n     Sunday, how could the repentant thief have been there with Him? The\n     answer lies in the location of \"paradise\" when Jesus died.\n\n     Apparently paradise was not exalted to heaven until Easter Day.\n\n     Jesus refers to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and \n     Lazarus as \"Abraham's Bosom,\" to which the godly beggar Lazarus was\n     carried by the angels after his decease (Luke 16:19-31).  Thus\n     \"Abraham's Bosom\" referred to the place where the souls of the redeemed\n     waited till the day of Christ's Resurrection.\n\n     It was not yet lifted to heaven but it may well have been a section of \n     hades (Hebrew: Sheol), reserved for believers who had died in the faith\n     but would not be admitted into the glorious presence of God in heaven\n     until the price of redemption had actually been paid on Calvary; or\n     even that none would precede the presence of Jesus back to glory with\n     the Father.\n\n     Doubtless it was the infernal paradise that the souls of Jesus and the\n     repentant thief repaired after they each died on Friday afternoon. But\n     on Sunday, after the risen Christ had first appeared to Mary Magdalene\n     (John 20:17) and her two companions (Matthew 28:9), presumably He then\n     took up with Him to glory all the inhabitants of infernal paradise\n     (including Abraham, Lazarus, and the repentant thief). We read in\n     Ephesians 4:8 concerning Christ: \"Ascending on high, He led captivity\n     captive; He gave gifts unto men.\" Verse 9 continues: \"But what does `He\n     ascended' mean but that He also descended to the lowest parts of the\n     earth?\" -i.e., to hades. Verse 10 adds: \"He who descended is the same\n     as He who ascended above all the heavens.\" Presumably He led the whole\n     band of liberated captives from hades (i.e., the whole population of\n     preresurrection paradise) up to the glory of heaven.\n\nra> Whenever your personal interpretation of Biblical passages is\nra> challenged, your only response seems to be that one needs merely to\nra> \"look at the Bible\" in order to see the truth, but what of those who\nra> see Biblical things differently from you?\n\n     I think that this characterization is faulty. Whenever my 'personal \n     interpretation' is questioned, I usually give a reason.\n\n     As for those that see things differently, please, put forward where\n     there is a valid difference, and we can discuss it. \n\n     I seem to be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one \n     views the Bible is somehow legitimate, except, or course, for the stuff \n     that I glean from it. Put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can \n     have a discussion on that topic. But to decry something that I put \n     forward, without putting forward something else to discuss, and to \n     dismiss what I put forward while giving credence to other alleged views\n     that have yet to be put forward is simply being contentious.\n\nra> Are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really\nra> understands it?\n\n     If you believe that something that I have drawn from Scripture is \n     wrong, then please, show me from Scripture where it is wrong.  Simply \n     stating that there are other views is not a proof. Show it to me from \n     Scripture and then we can go on.\n", "label": 19}

{"text": "[cont. Dr. James DeYoung; #3]\n\nR. Scroggs\n\n     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and\nsuggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\n\"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\nterminology.\"  The term is derived from Lev 18\"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\njuxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\"), and represents\nthe Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\").   Yet he believes that Paul did\nnot originate the term, but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews\nacquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\n\"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\nobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\nof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\nnative-speaking Greeks (108).\n\n     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\nobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's \"learned discussion\"\n(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a\nmale\" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\nwhich Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call-boy,\" arsenokoitai is the\nactive partner \"who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on\noccasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\nrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\nmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\naffirms (109).\n     This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\ncombination of pornoi (\"fornicators\"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave\ndealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\ndealers [who procure them]\" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\npederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\npurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males\" (121).  Even \"serious\nminded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\ninstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\ngeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \nConsequently Paul \"Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind\" (122).\nWe cannot know what Paul would have said about the \"contemporary model of\nadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships\" (122).\n\n     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical\nconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of\nvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\nfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\nrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\nnonexistent.  He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in\nthe lists\" (104). \n\n     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\nphenomenon of a \"catalogue of vices,\"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are\n\"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today\" (129).  The \"model\nin today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model\nattacked by the NT\" that \"Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not\nrelevant to today's debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational\ndiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify\nrefusal of ordination. . . \" (127).\n\n      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\n\nD. Wright\n\n     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\ncome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's\nview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\nseveral shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\nBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\n18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the \"Apostolic\nConstitutions,\"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \nBoswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\nderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\nis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell's\nclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\ngender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with\na male,\" making arseno- the object.\n\n     Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the\nterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\ncompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\nas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\none of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference\nbetween the two forms\" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\nthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\nobject and where \"the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\ngender\" (132). \n\n     It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\ntakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \nFor example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\nandrobaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\nhomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\nHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\nSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\nthe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \n\n     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\nparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\ndominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\nparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\"), porneia\n(\"fornication\"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\n(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\nTen Commandments as \"You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit\nadultery\"), ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with\nboys\"), you shall not steal. . .\" (150 n. 43).\n\n     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the\nSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\ncoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\nOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\n\n     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\nupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\nthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\nhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\n\n     Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be\nabsent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\n(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\nthe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\ndozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\nDidache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing\nScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \n\n     Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention\n(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\nomitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\nlong uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\n1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.  Wright\nobserves that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of\narsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\nactivity\" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\nand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\nspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \n\n     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\nand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\n\"homosexual\" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\nthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited\nconclusion based on them.\n\n     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\ncatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\nin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\nhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\npart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\nbeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke \"generally of\nmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\nengagement with paides\" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\ninterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\n\n     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\nhomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\nothers who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without\nsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.  ", "label": 15}

This will be the \n\nfirst IRQ serviced by the system, giving the modem a better response -- \nespecially handy under multitaskers like OS/2 -- which I'm running with no\nproblems.\n\nJustin", "label": 3}

{"text": "\nFrom: \"Preston K. Covey\" <covey+@andrew.cmu.edu>\nSubject: Gun Stats & Mortal Risks\nDate: Mon, 15 Feb 1993 18:35:05 -0500 (EST)\n\n\nFolks,\n\nHail from the nether world.  On February 4th, the Wall Street Journal\ncarried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled \"Armed Force.\"  I\nfelt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat\nthat \"A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect.\"  I sent\nthe following to the WSJ.\n\n-----\n\nGun Stats & Mortal Risks\n\nPreston K. Covey\n\n\n\tErik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~\n2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns\nin the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King\nCounty, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more\nlikely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to\nkill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it\nhas grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated\nby one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of\nthe finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine\n(NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping\nfirearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~ \n \n\tResponsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of\nbringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this: \nWhat exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither\nthe whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the\nrisks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control\ndo we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of\ncancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the\nrisks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful\nhere. \n\n\tThe NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us\noff.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a\nmisleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice\nand terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far\noutweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your\ncar were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or\nan innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not\ntake the bus?  \n\n\tUncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company\nof lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at\nstake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:\n\n\tThe ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the\nnumber of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense\n(the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed\nby a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation\nis 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other\ncases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12\naccidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided\nby 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King\nCounty between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of\nhomes unaccounted.\n\n\tThe NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on\nsix counts:\n\n\t1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or\nacquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and\nneighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is\nthat the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members,\ndear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic,\nbut the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are\nrelevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the\ncalculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless\nWaltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is\ncriminological hogwash.\n\n\t2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs\npopulated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories\n-- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited\nby more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities\nlike drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is\nvery low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but\navoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with\nhistories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and\ncertifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious\nrisk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as\nignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither\ngun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or\nvehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver\ncrucially affect the risk. \n\n\t3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is\nthat the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill\nthan to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of\npersonal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike\nLarson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43\ntimes as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun\nViolence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this\nparticular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about\nwhether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by\ntautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question\nbegged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any\ncase, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal\ninstruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths\nare personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility\nobviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by\ngun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to\nNEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself. \nPeople have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their\nhomes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection\ncourse do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and\nsober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death\nas do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard\nand obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they\ndisregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and\nother risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we\nresent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose\nnorms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign\nus to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in\nthe matter.\n\n\t4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the\nNEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County,\nincluding those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total\ndeath toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other\nstudies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from\nhomicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these\nsuicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true\nthat attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously\ntrue that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these\nsuicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of\nresearch on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is\nwishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce\nL. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press,\n1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of\nPsychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of\nthe NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to\n~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the\ncauses, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a\nprofoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally\ndisregard this issue.\n\n\t5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable\nrate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the\nNEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases. \nBut many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled\nself-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case\ndispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of\njustifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story\non women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women\nwho appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17,\n1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic\ncases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were\nreported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported\nthat 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In\nTime~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error\nby a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged\nby promulgators of the NEJM statistic. \n\n\t6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation\nare arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The\ndivisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not\naggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even\nshot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the\ncoin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy\nis it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure\nthe utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as\nopposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or\ndeterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where\nno human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed\nto media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the\ncompendious research on successful armed defense, notably by\ncriminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America ,\nAldine de Gruyter, 1992)?\n\tKleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are\nbased on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is\nhigh (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare\nbetter than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance\nor those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year\nby 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and\naccidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable\nstatistic than the NEJM scare stat:  \n\nA gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or\nother crime than to kill anybody.   \n\n\tOf course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation;\nwhat is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We\nshould indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation\nof defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic. \nClearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by\nuncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we\ncan hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we\nhardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically.\n", "label": 16}

{"text": "Forwarded from:\nPUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICE\nJET PROPULSION LABORATORY\nCALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\nNATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION\nPASADENA, CALIF. 91109. (818) 354-5011\n\nContact:  Mary A. Hardin\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993\n#1506\n\n     Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the\nsuccessful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to\nmeasure and study chemicals in the Earth's ozone layer.\n\n     The April 3 flight from California's Barstow/Daggett Airport\nreached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took\nmeasurements as part of a program established to correlate data\nwith the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).  \n\n     The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to\nreadings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy\n(ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle\nDiscovery.\n\n     \"We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an\nongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively\ninvolved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three\nimportant ways,\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on\nthe balloon research campaign.  \n\n     \"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\" he\ncontinued.  \"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,\nand the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth\nfor those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own\nright.\"\n\n     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more\npieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the\nmid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. \nUnderstanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps\nscientists construct more accurate computer models which are\ninstrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.\n\n     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL\ninstruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures\nozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;\na submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave\nradiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier\ntransform infrared interferometer which monitors how the\natmosphere absorbs sunlight. \n\n     Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-\nhour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130\nkilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground\nstations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.\nPacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded\nto separate from the balloon.\n\n     \"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared\nmeasurements,\" Margitan explained, \"and we also needed to fly in\ndarkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\"\n\n     It will be several weeks before scientists will have the\ncompleted results of their experiments.  They will then forward\ntheir data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space\nFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS\nscientists.    \n\n     The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon\nFacility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a\ncontract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was\nlaunched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction\nand the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.\n\n     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than\none-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic\nmeters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with\nhelium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh\nbetween 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The\nscientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds\nand is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.\n\n     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA's Upper\nAtmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements\nProgram.

Imake support has been improved, a few defaults have\nbeen changed, and a lot of other small things have been added.\n\nThis is basically a release which drops the 'gamma' status. Next release will\nincorporate some improvements by Stefan Schwarz, and possibly will support\nX11R5 and Motif 1.2.x.\n\nNote to all of those who keep copies of the archive: please retrieve this\ndistribution (during off-peak hours), and delete all previous copies.\n\nHere is the original ANNOUNCEMENT:\n\nHISTORY\n\nThe University of Lowell, supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation,\nhas developed a wrapper-library, that encapsulates Motif widgets in C++\nclasses. All resources of these Widgets can now be set through\nmember-functions, while objects can be used in callback-functions. The library\nwas made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1.\nHowever, the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights, and only\nworked under X11R3. Due to lack of subsequent fundings, the bindings are no\nlonger actively supported by the University of Lowell.\n\nI, Ronald van Loon, at a certain point last year, have taken the Lowell \nbindings, fixing the bugs I came across, adding missing memberfunctions, and\nenhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the\ngeneral public for anonymous ftp (made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC).\n\nNEW RELEASE\n\nI am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif++\nbindings. \n\nThis release offers:\n\n- Full Motif1.1 and X11R4 support\n- Support for Xbae widgetset \n- Two additional widgets, written by myself, that can be used to indicate\n  progress in an application.\n- Imake support. NB: this release relies heavily on the existence of imake\n\t\t     and its config files on your site. I have tried to\n\t\t     provide the bindings with a standard Makefile, tweakable\n\t\t     for those unfortunates without imake. I have not severely\n\t\t     tested the standard Makefile though. Contact me if you\n\t\t     have problems. The reason for calling this a gamma\n\t\t     release lies in the fact that I do not have a multitude\n\t\t     of platforms to test the Imake-files on.\n- Lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs)\n- An article I wrote on the usage of Motif, X and C++, previously posted\n  on Usenet.\n\nWHERE TO GET THE NEW MOTIF BINDINGS\n\nFtp:\n\nAnonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1), directory /pub/X11.\n\nNote:\n\nPlease be patient as the network link is quite slow. Please do not FTP large\nfiles during working hours.\n\nAlso note that there is also a motif++.31.jan.92.tar.Z file at this site; this\nis an old version of the bindings.\n\nE-mail:\n\nThose who don't have ftp can send me e-mail, and I will send the bindings by\ne-mail.\n\nREQUEST\n\nThose who use the bindings and find bugs, or see room for improvement, please\ncontact me, and I will try to incorporate them in a future release (in case of\nbugs, a bug-fix of course ;-). \n\nMORE INFORMATION \n\nContact me at \"rvloon@cv.ruu.nl\".\nIf you are desperate, then you can call me at\n+31 30 506711 (that is Utrecht, the Netherlands; those within the Netherlands\ncall 030-506711).\n\nEnjoy!\n", "label": 5}

{"text": "Here's one I hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment or\ncontribution to:\n\nIn the State of Virginia radar detectors are illegal, period.  If\nyou are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will\nnot be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. \nThe fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle\n(even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of\nthe law is no excuse - they will get you too!\n\nIt used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for\nan officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many\nlaw enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. \nRight, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF\nfrom the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was \"no way!\" \nBut, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police\nare writing citations right and left for people using radar\ndetectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had\nfound the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,\nand he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was\nthere.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.\n\nNow, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or\nnear the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me\nfrom getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my\nspeed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar\ndetector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which\nis what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to\nobey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.\n\nFor my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only\nworks in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave\nenlightment may be necessary.\n\nSo, the questions are -\n  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?\n  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by\n  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector\n  antenna?\n  Are any brands \"quieter\" than others?", "label": 12}

PDS (processor direct slot) is just that:\nhere are all the connections to the processor. You can do anything with\nthis and it is as quick as it can be, but there's no cooperation.

Security Council Resolution 713 of \n  September 25, 1991, the United Nations has been actively \n  addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.  The Security \n  Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all \n  unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There \n  have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages \n  in Bosnia have been bombed.\n  \n  In response to these violations, the Security Council decided, \n  in Resolution 816 of March 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all \n  unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and to authorize \n  Member States, acting nationally or through regional organi-\n  zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance.  \n  NATO's North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed to provide NATO air \n  enforcement for the no-fly zone.  The U.N. Secretary General \n  was notified of NATO's decision to proceed with Operation DENY \n  FLIGHT, and an activation order was delivered to participating \n  allies.\n  \n  The United States actively supported these decisions.  At my \n  direction, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to \n  all U.S. forces participating in the NATO force, for the conduct \n  of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by \n  the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The U.S. forces \n  initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F-15 and \n  12 F-18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft.  \n  These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m. \n  e.d.t. on April 12, 1993.  The fighter aircraft are equipped for \n  combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense.\n  \n  NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air \n  patrol (CAP) stations within the control of Airborne Early \n  Warning (AEW) aircraft.  The U.S. CAP aircraft will normally \n  operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the \n  Adriatic Sea.  Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching \n  the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted, \n  escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order).  If these \n  steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such \n  aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by \n  NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved \n  \n                                more\n  \n       \t    \t      \t   \t     \t       \t    (OVER)\n\f\n                                  2\n  \n  rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will \n  be necessary.  The Commander of UNPROFOR (the United Nations \n  Protection Force currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina) was \n  consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully \n  considered before the rules of engagement were approved.\n  \n  It is not possible to predict at this time how long such \n  operations will be necessary.  I have directed U.S. armed forces \n  to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional \n  authority as Commander in Chief.  I am grateful for the con-\n  tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort, and \n  I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward \n  toward attainment of our goals in this region.\n  \n       \t    \t      \t   \tSincerely,\n  \n  \n  \n  \n       \t    \t      \t   \tWILLIAM J.

You can talk about how\nimportant calling a game is, or framing the pitches, or blocking balls\nin the dirt.  But there is little or no way to tell exactly how various\ncatcher's rank in \"defense\".  \n\n\tLooking at Lopez specifically; is there any reason to suspect\nthat he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the Braves\n(or the media) has labeled him a bad defensive catcher?  As far as I\ncan tell he doesn't have any particular problem in his mechanics\n(such as Sasser).  He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking\nthe ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to\nclear that up is playing and practice time.  I can't see how repetitions\nat AAA are any better then reps in the majors!  \n\n\tAll we're left with is the calling the game aspect.  Olsen  and\nBerryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping\nthe pitchering staff.  But this is a reputation that is given to almost\nall veteran catchers.

Similarly, I wouldn't\nbe supprised if the pitcher's claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over\npitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen.  But \ngiven time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez.\n\n\tNow, since Lopez can't learn how to handle the major league\npitcher's while he's in AAA and since he doesn't have any glaring\nproblem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in AAA that he\ncan't learn just as well while in the majors?

It won't be as easy as it was defeating Senate\nBill 266 in 1991.\n\nPossible actions to take in response:\n\n1)  Mobilize your friends to to all the things on this list, and\nmore.\n\n2)  Work the Press.  Talk with your local newspaper's science and\ntechnology reporter.  Write to your favorite trade rags.  Better yet,\nwrite some articles yourself for your favorite magazines or\nnewspapers.  Explain why the Clipper chip initiative is a bad idea. \nRemember to tailor it to your audience.  The general public may be\nslow to grasp why it's a bad idea, since it seems so technical and\narcane and innocent sounding.  Try not to come across as a flaming\nlibertarian paranoid extremist, even if you are one. \n\n3)  Lobby Congress.  Write letters and make phone calls to your\nMember of Congress in your own district, as well as your two US\nSenators.  Many Members of Congress have aides that advise them of\ntechnology issues.  Talk to those aides.\n\n4)  Involve your local political parties.  The Libertarian party\nwould certainly be interested.  There are also libertarian wings of\nthe Democrat and Republican parties.  The right to privacy has a\nsurprisingly broad appeal, spanning all parts of the political\nspectrum.  We have many natural allies.  The ACLU.  The NRA.  Other\nactivist groups that may someday find themselves facing a government\nthat can suppress them much more efficiently if these trends play\nthemselves out.  But you must articulate our arguments well if you\nwant to draw in people who are not familiar with these issues.\n\n4)  Contribute money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and\nComputer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), assuming\nthese groups will fight this initiative.  They need money for legal\nexpenses and lobbying.\n\n5)  Mobilize opposition in industry.  Companies that will presumably\ndevelop products that will incorporate the Clipper chip should be\nlobbied against it, from within and from without.  If you work for a\ntelecommunications equipment vendor, first enlist the aid of your\ncoworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative, and then\npresent your company's management with a united front of engineering\ntalent against this initiative.  Write persuasive memos to your\nmanagement, with your name and your colleagues' names on it.  Hold\nmeetings on it.\n\n6)  Publicize, deploy and entrench as much guerrilla\ntechno-monkeywrenching apparatus as you can.  That means PGP,\nanonymous mail forwarding systems based on PGP, PGP key servers,\netc.  The widespread availability of this kind of technology might\nalso be used as an argument that it can't be effectively suppressed\nby Government action.  I will also be working to develop new useful\ntools for these purposes. \n\n7)  Be prepared to engage in an impending public policy debate on\nthis topic.  We don't know yet how tough this fight will be, so we\nmay have to compromise to get most of what we want.  If we can't\noutright defeat it, we may have to live with a modified version of\nthis Clipper chip plan in the end.  So we'd better be prepared to\nanalyze the Government's plan, and articulate how we want it\nmodified.\n", "label": 11}

{"text": "\n\nDr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally \nbe believed. I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing \nGoebels' rule quite loyally. 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks \nwho are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However, in today's \ninformed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For \ninstance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they \nwatched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can \nread the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what \nreally happened. \n\nThere are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital, The Greek Girls' Lycee \nAlumni Association, the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society, \nthe Greek Medical Foundation, the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation, \nthe Yovakimion Greek Girls' Lycee Foundation, and the Fener Greek \nMen's Lycee Foundation.  \n\nAs for Greece, the longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' \nin titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts \nhave ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association, \nthe Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti \nTurkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks\nin Western Thrace. Such community associations had been \nactive until 1984. But they were first told to remove\nthe word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official\npapers and then eventually close down. This is also the \nfinal verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.\n\nIn the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish\nparentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment\nwith no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was\nof Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official\nwas also deprived of his political rights for a period of three \nyears. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than \na vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority \ncomplex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye. \n\nThe Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,' \nwhich demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference \nto 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the \nexistence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the \nessential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger \nTurkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the \nthree nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of \nthemselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized \naccording to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.'\n\nIt also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece \nand the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.\nThe Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish\nminority. They pursue the same denial in connection with \nthe Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,\nin 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,\nvirtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and\nother charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting\nreligious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek \ngovernments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective\nof the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although\nthe Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in\nGreece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing\nits religious leaders. Talk about democracy.\n\nThe government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic \nconvention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an \nattitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a \nviolation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' \nGreek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection \nof historical monuments. \n\nThe government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new \nchurches in remote villages as a complementary step toward \nHellenizing the region.\n\nAnd you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human \nRights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by \nthe Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation \nof the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation, \nSidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of \nKefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina. \nHis employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in \n24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his \ninvolvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice \nand remains without a job. \n\nHelsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating \nthe plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their \nfindings were published in a report titled \n\n 'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'\n\nThe report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the \nTurkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, \nthe Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in \nKomotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against \nthe Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the \nLausanne Convention. \n\nThe Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik\nwere attacked, and tombstones were broken. The cemetery in\nKarotas was razed by bulldozers.\n\nShall I go on? Why not? The people of Turkiye are not going \nto take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The \ndiscussion of human rights violations in Greece does not \nstop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles \nI shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks\nin Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians.\n\nIt has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration \nhas an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made \nplans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it \nhas to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on \nconventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile, Greek \nand Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned \nto take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the \ntransfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern \nCyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of \nthe agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.\n\nAn acceptable method may certainly be found when there\nis a will. But we know of various kinds of violent\nbehaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning\nof buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were \ndragged out to the front of the building and burnt there. \nShots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana.\n\nNow wait, there is more.\n\n  'Greek Atrocities in the Vilayet of Smyrna (May to July 1919), Inedited\n  Documents and Evidence of English and French Officers,' Published by\n  The Permanent Bureau of the Turkish Congress at Lausanne, Lausanne,\n  Imprimerie Petter, Giesser & Held, Caroline, 5 (1919).\n\n  pages 82-83:\n\n<< 1. The train going from Denizli to Smyrna was stopped at Ephesus\n   and the 90 Turkish travellers, men and women who were in it ordered\n   to descend. And there in the open street, under the eyes of their\n   husbands, fathers and brothers, the women without distinction of age\n   were violated, and then all the travellers were massacred. Amongst\n   the latter the Lieutenant Salih Effendi, a native of Tripoli, and a\n   captain whose name is not known, and to whom the Hellenic authorities\n   had given safe conduct, were killed with specially atrocious tortures.\n\n   2. Before the battle, the wife of the lawyer Enver Bey coming from\n   her garden was maltreated by Greek soldiers, she was even stript\n   of her garments and her servant Assie was violated.\n\n   3. The two tax gatherers Mustapha and Ali Effendi were killed in the\n   following manner: Their arms were bound behind their backs with wire\n   and their heads were battered and burst open with blows from the butt\n   end of a gun.\n\n   4. During the firing of the town, eleven children, six little girls\n   and five boys, fleeing from the flames, were stopped by Greek soldiers\n   in the Ramazan Pacha quarter, and thrown into a burning Jewish house\n   near bridge, where they were burnt alive. This fact is confirmed on oath\n   by the retired commandant Hussein Hussni Effendi who saw it.\n\n   5. The clock-maker Ahmed Effendi and his son Sadi were arrested and\n   dragged out of their shop. The son had his eyes put out and was then\n   killed in the court of the Greek Church, but Ahmed Effendi has been\n   no more heard of.\n\n   6. At the market, during the fire, two unknown people were wounded\n   by bayonets, then bound together, thrown into the fire and burnt alive.\n\n   The Greeks killed also many Jews.

{"text": "Archive-Name: rec-autos/part6\n\n[New article as of 4 February 1993 -- rpw]\n\n\nMany people want to set up mailing lists for their favorite\nautomotive topics; rather fewer know how to do it.  This article\nwill provide the essential information for doing so on standard\nUnix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups\nare included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com\nfor a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive\nmailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can\nlist it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the\nUsenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)\n\nFirst of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin,\nor 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also\nimportant that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems\nlike you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you\nhave trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is\nprobably not good enough.\n\nListserv:\n\nThere is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which\nis available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of\nthe installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this\narticle, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should\nprobably  look at listserv carefully.\n\nThe Alias file:\n\nOn a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on\nwhichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:\n\nfoo:   bar, baz, bletch\n\n\nwhich means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host is\nredistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest\npossible email list is \n\nmy-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\n\nthis has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that\nyou have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can\ndo the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:\n\nmy-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\n\nWhere the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated\naddresses.  This file can be in the list admin's home directory,\nowned by the list admin.\n\nBounced Mail:\n\nthis still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the\nmembers of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating.\nTherefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up\nis instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup,\nby the way.  I'm not sure where he got it from.)\n\n\nschool-request:   welty\nschool-rebroadcast:  :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/list\nschool: \"|/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school\"\nowner-school: school-request\nowner-school-out: school-request\n\n\nhere's what is going on here:\n\nthe owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail\ncoming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the point\nof contact for administrative duties.\n\nschool is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses,\nit points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending\nthe email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name;\nthe name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at the\nactual list members.\n\nthe shell script i use is as follows:\n\n-----------------\n#!/bin/sh\ncd /tmp\nsed -e '/^Reply-To:/d' -e '/^Sender:/d' -e '/^From /d' | \\\n        (echo Reply-To: ${1}@balltown.cma.com; \\\n         echo Errors-To: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\n         echo Sender: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\n         cat -) | \\\n        /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \\\n                -F \"The ${1} Mailing List\" ${1}-rebroadcast\nexit 0\n-------------------\n\nnote that this script does not know the name of the list; the name\nis passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiple\nlists (i run several out of this site.)\nthe script excises Reply-To:, Sender:, and From lines from the incoming\nmessage, substitutes for Sender: and Reply-To:, and adds Errors-to:\n99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -request\nor owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done.\n\nFor digested lists, there is some digestification software around.\nHopefully I'll be able to provide more information in a future version\nof this posting.\n\nrichard welty (welty@balltown.cma.com)", "label": 7}

{"text": "\nA number of points.  You are making assumptions about the manner\nin which the cards are used.  True, by law, all residents, citizens,\nand tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  For\ncitizens, the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serves\non a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places,\nis for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes place\nin banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc...\nQuite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card\nfor such activities more than once per week.  There is no law or\nrequirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public.\nFurthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate against\nthe bearer in any manner by having access to this information.\n\nThe only case that I can think of in which the Le'um field might\nbe taken into account is during interaction with the police,\nbased upon the scenario.  In general though, arab citizens are\nclearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument therefore\nbecomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field\nis being used to discriminate against them officially.\n\n\n\nI take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countries\ndo know that they have nothing to fear from \"Israeli expansionism\".\nMilitarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of\nland under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for a\nsustained period of time.  As is, the intifada is heavily taxing\nthe Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli\nwithdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from the\nAwali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimal\nstrip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire.\nPublic opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada\nvia territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring from\nbattle fatigue of sorts and the gov't is aware of it.\n\nWith regards to borders, let me state the following.  I may not agree\nwith the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the crux\nof the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating\na starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawal\nand a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders,\nthe negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to state\nsmaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smaller\nborders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to be\nsettled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic\nand sensible.\n\n\nYour statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a \"center for\npolicy research\".  Whether or not all of Vanunu's revelations were true has no\nbearing on the fact that some were.  For disclosing \"state secrets\"\nafter having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that\nsaid secrets are not to be made public, one should be punished.\nAs to which were and which weren't, I am under no moral obligation\nto disclose that - quite the reverse in fact.\nHe was taken to court, tried, and found guilty.  You may take issue\nwith a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the\nconcept of \"Secrets of state\", something which every democratic govt\nhas.\n\n\nI noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist\nmore than he documented the fact that they do exist.  The CLU noted,\nwhich you evidently did not pay attention to, that they know of no such\nreports or cases.  I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill,\nas tightly knit as Israel, even if the matter of the arrest was not\nmade public, within a relatively short time frame, most people would know\nabout it.  My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be\nmade public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours.\nThis would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an\nannouncement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation.\n\n\nWell, I am sorry to say that your questions are slanted.  Such\nquestions are often termed \"tabloid journalism\" and are not\ndisturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity.\nSuch questions were often used during the McCarthy era as\na basis for the witch-hunts that took place then.  To use\nyour own example, these questions might have been lifted\nfrom the format used by Stalinist prosecutors that were looking\nfor small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray\nas a larger and dirtier picture.\n\nMy answers were not any more \"hysterical\" than the questions\nthemselves.  The problem is not that the q's were provocative,\nit was that they were selective in their fact seeking.  You\nfall into the same category of those who seek \"yes\" \"no\" answers\nwhen the real answer is \"of sorts\".\nI suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not an\nunequivocal NO, you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete\nthem as you see fit.  A sign of strength is the ability to look\nYou remind me of those mistaken environmentalists who once advocated\nculling wolves because of the cruelty to deer, only to find that they\nhad broken the food chain and wreaked havoc upon the very environment\nthey sought to protect.  The color blindness you exhibit is a true\nsign of weakness.\n\n\nDitto.\n", "label": 17}
{"text": "Archive-name: rec-autos/part4\n\n[this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly\nasked automotive questions; the other article contains questions\nof general consumer interest, and is broken out to facilitate\ncrossposting to misc.consumers -- rpw]\n\n[last change: 8 February 1993; CT now permits radar detector usage,\n    new tire-traction q&a -- rpw]\n\n                Commonly Asked Questions\n\nRadar Questions:\n\nQ:  Where are radar detectors illegal?\n\nA:  In the US, currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit\n    all usage of radar detectors.  New York prohibits their use in\n    large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,\n    Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They\n    are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.\n    Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other\n    jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.\n\nQ:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?\n\nA:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,\n    but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe\n    to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.\n    They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently\n    available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate\n    more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.\n    New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected\n    by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a\n    detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned\n    on.\n\nQ:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?\n\nA:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance\n    computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target\n    vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR\n    system.\n\nQ:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be\n    able to handle it? \n\nA:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US\n    in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a\n    low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the\n    direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the\n    radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.\n    Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low\n    power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar\n    detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,\n    although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such\n    capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use\n    is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:\n    learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they\n    are used (or else, don't speed.)\n\nQ:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?\n\nA:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.\n    Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.\n    Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the\n    military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the\n    Federal Communications Commission of the USA.\n\nDriving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:\n\nQ:  What are understeer and oversteer?\n\nA:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a\n    car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)\n    Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to\n    be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they\n    tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',\n    or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)\n    Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that\n    untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into\n    trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle\n    in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance\n    oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing\n    throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle\n    may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or\n    spinning.\n\n    Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car\n    will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the\n    angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling\n    and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to\n    travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle\n    than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater\n    slip angle than the front wheels.\n\nQ: What is a rev-matched downshift?\n\nA: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear\n   than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally\n   you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop\n   rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle\n   before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to\n   the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.\n\nQ: What does heel-and-toe mean?\n\nA: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while\n   braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot\n   for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you\n   use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to\n   match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;\n   often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side\n   on the throttle.\n\n   Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the\n   left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing\n   the same thing.\n\nQ: What is double-clutch downshifting?\n\nA: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of\n   three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for\n   declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the\n   transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with\n   rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch\n   engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission\n   speed up.\n\n   The procedure is as follows:\n   (0) declutch\n   (1) move gearshift lever to neutral\n   (2) engage clutch\n   (3) match revs\n   (4) declutch\n   (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear\n   (6) engage clutch\n\n   This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.\n   The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the\n   synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or\n   with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.\n   Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at\n   all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good\n   condition.\n\nQ: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and\n   slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?\n\nA: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and\n   2) almost never.\n\n   In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times\n   in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the\n   same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine\n   that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite\n   pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from\n   driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*\n   major) part of the equation.\n\n   Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really\n   only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically\n   when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the\n   comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.\n   This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads\n   are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply\n   of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.\n\n   Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the\n   automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced\n   by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the\n   car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making\n   a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end\n   of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car\n   has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'\n   setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of\n   caveats could go on for page after page.\n\nQ: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according\n   to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate\n   or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?\n\nA: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.\n\n   2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics\n   textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,\n   none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a\n   stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating\n   temperature.\n\n   Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser\n   extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a\n   substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been\n   coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match\n   the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire\n   at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses\n   inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling\n   friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire\n   is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will\n   be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its\n   proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some\n   part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like\n   to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.\n   (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal\n   street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of\n   high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)\n\n   Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,\n   it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters\n   accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than\n   1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible\n   for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of\n   grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques\n   such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.\n\nMisc. Questions:\n\nQ:  What does <name or acronym> stand for?\n\nA:  Here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked\n    about; be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names\n    as misinformation abounds on the net.  In particular, NEVER\n    ask in rec.humor if you want a useful result.\n\n    Saab:   Svenska Aeroplan A. B.,\n              or The Swedish Airplane Corporation\n\n    Alfa:   Societa Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili,\n              or The Lombardy Automobile Manufacturing Company\n\n    Fiat:   Fabbrica Italiana di Automobili Torino,\n              or The Italian Automobile Manufacturers of Turin\n\n    BMW:    Bayerische Motoren Werke,\n              or Bavarian Motor Works\n\n    MG:     Morris Garage\n\n\nQ:  Does VW own Porsche?\n\nA:  No.  Porsche is a publicly held company, controlled by the Porsche and\n    Piech families.  Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,\n    which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some\n    financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may\n    be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this\n    is only speculation at this time.", "label": 7}

{"text": "\nA word of warning, though:  Kryptonite also sells almost useless cable\nlocks under the Kryptonite name.\n\nWhen I obtained my second motorcycle, I migrated one of my Kryptonite \nU-locks from my bicycle to the new bike.  I then went out shopping for\na new lock for the bicycle.\n\nFor about the same money ($20) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock\n(advantages: lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both,\nKryptonite name) or a cheesy no-name U-lock (advantages: real steel).\nI chose the Kryptonite cable.  After less than a week, I took it back in\ndisgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock.\n\nFirst, the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite, is not covered by\nthe Kryptonite guarantee, and doesn't even approach Kryptonite standards of\nquality and quality assurance.  It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable\nlock with the Kryptonite name on it.\n\nSecondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.  I\ndon't know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was often\nquite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimes\nit would seem to engage, only to fall open when I went to unlock it.\n\nThirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves\nthe sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the \ndark.  I didn't try it (obviously), but I have my doubts that the \nlock mechanism would stand up to an \"insert screwdriver and TORQUE\"\nattack.\n\nFourthly, the cable was not, in my opinion, of sufficient thickness to \ndeter theft (for my piece of crap bicycle, that is).

Deir Yassin was later\n   advertized by the very Jews who perpetrated it because it was\n   useful in getting many Palestinians to leave.

In fact, Begin,\nwho was in charge of the Irgun, wrote that Dir Yassin was attacked for\nits military significance.\n\nDir Yassin was merely a battle in the War of Liberation. People died.\nBut the thing was never intended to be a masacre. That this hapenned\nis a tragedy of war - not a crime of the Irgun.", "label": 17}

Perhaps that village of Khojalu\ntown was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's\n3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...\n\nThe massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of\nthis massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.\n\nSome of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability\nto ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.\n\nYesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro.

With support of everybody and every organization claiming\nto be civilized.\n\nCould there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the\nright to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-?

{"text": "\n\nActually I don't think there is any conflict if we really understand\nwhat these passages say.  First, what is faith?  If you study the \nmeaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will\ncome to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere \nbelief.  Faith means both trust and action.  If you do not put your \nbelief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith.  I think this \nis what James means when he says that \"faith without works is dead\" \nand, \"I will show you my faith by my works.\"  Remember James was \nwriting to \"the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad.\"  This \nprobably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much \nlater and wouldn't understand the meaning of the original Greek.\n(Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others he\nintended to reach.)  Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to the\npeople of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of\nthe Greek.\n\nAnother key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul's\nstatements in their context.  I think you will find that when Paul\ncontrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the\ngospel with the Law, meaning the Law of Moses.  This was the great\nburden of Paul's life.  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go\nconvert a bunch of people, then the \"Judizers\" would come along and\ntry to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses (cf\nActs chapter 15).  In this context Paul condemns the idea of being\nsaved by the works of the Law, saying that we are saved by the blood\nof Jesus and our faith in him.  I believe that a better translation\nfor today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*.  I think\n\"faithfulness\" today has a meaning closer to what the original\nwriters intended.\n\n\nI think you misunderstand Romans.  What Paul is really saying is\nthat God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not \"keep kosher\" to a\nkosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters\nof following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows.\n\n\nIn the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and \nbe lukewarm.  If you know God but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are \nworse off than the person who never heard of Him.  Remember, Jesus in\nthe parable of the pearl of great price (Mat 13:45-46) and again in\nthe one on the treasure hidden in the field (Mat 13:44) indicates that\nthe price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have.\n\n[I agree with you in general, including the fact that \"pistis\" has\nsome of the force of \"faithful\".  However if you take that too far,\nyou can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have\nintended.  Being faithful means following God in all things.  To say\nthat we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we\nare saved by commiting no sins.  I assume that's not what you meant.\n\nI have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that\ncompletely captures this.  However I think Paul is describing what I'd\ncall a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust and\ncommitment.  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basic\nchange.  We may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to show\nthe new life in Christ in many situations where we should.  But in any\nChristian there had better be the basic change in orientation that\nJesus calls being born again.", "label": 15}

During the course of evening I asked \n Ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and \n the cause of its destruction. In his matter of fact way he replied, Yes, \n I assisted in its sack and destruction, and witnessed the slaying of \n those whose bones you saw to-day scattered among its ruins.\" \n\np. 202 (first and second paragraphs).\n\n\"We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as \n ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work \n of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. \n Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts \n into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable \n and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets \n completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They \n found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border \n into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole \n length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to \n Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain \n plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of \n Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for \n howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the \n scattered bones of the dead.\" \n\np. 15 (second paragraph).\n\n\"The Tartars were, for the most part, poor. Some of them lived in villages \n and cultivated small farms; many of them continued in the way of life of \n their nomadic forefathers. They drove their flocks and herds from valley \n to valley, from plain to mountain, and from mountain to plain, following \n the pasturage as it changed with the seasons. They ranged from the salt \n desert shores of the Caspian Sea far into the mighty Caucasus Mountains. \n Even the village Tartars are a primitive people, only semicivilized.\"\n\n\"I can see now that we Armenians frankly despised the Tartars, and, while \n holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country, regarded and\n treated them as inferiors. The fact that the Russians looked down upon all\n Armenians in much the same way as Armenians regarded Tartars, far from proving\n a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors, intensified\n an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility.\"\n\np. 20 (second paragraph).\n\n\"Our men armed themselves, gathered together and advanced on the Tartar\n section of the village. There were no lights in the houses and the doors\n were barred, for the Tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great \n fear. Our men hammered on the doors, but got no response; whereupon they\n smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last\n Tartar was slain. Throughout the hideous night, I cowered at home in terror,\n unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and\n the loud shouts of our men. By morning the work was finished.\"\n\np. 109 (second paragraph).\n\n\"As things were, the members of the Dashnack Party were without administrative\n experience; consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself\n incompetent to rule by legitimate means.\n\n The members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and\n outside the law. When they became a legally instituted, recognized governing\n body with the destiny of Armenia in their hands, they proved incompetent to \n do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their \n fight against the Russian and Turkish Governments in their outlaw days.\n\n The outstanding feature of their rule, now that they were in power, was,\n as in the old days, trial and execution without hearing. A man evoking\n the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and\n condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him. The method \n of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the\n condemned man in his home or on the street, place a pistol to the back\n of his head and blow out his brains. This simple way of getting rid of\n those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became\n a common way of paying debts.\"\n\np. 203 (first paragraph).\n\n\"A soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the Tartar. I saw the\n point of the weapon emerge through his back. ...Another soldier seized a rock \n and pounded the Tartar's head with it... The Armenian who had bayoneted him\n sprang to his feet, wrested the weapon from the Tartar's body, and, raising\n it to his lips, licked it clean of blood, exclaiming in Russian, 'Slodkey!\n Slodkey!' (Sweet.)\"\n\np. 203 (second paragraph).\n\n\"One evening I passed through what had been a Tartar village. Among the \n ruins a fire was burning. I went to the fire and saw seated about\n it a group of soldiers. Among them were two Tartar girls, mere children.\n The girls were crouched on the ground, crying softly with suppressed\n sobs. Lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and\n other furnishings of Tartar peasant homes. There were also bodies of the\n dead.\"\n\np. 204 (first paragraph).\n\n\"I was soon asleep. In the night I was awakened by the persistent crying of\n a child. I arose and went to investigate. A full moon enabled me to make\n my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy\n that had been enacted. Guided by the child's crying, I entered the yard of\n a house, which I judged from its appearance must have been the home of a\n Turkish family. There in a corner of the yard I found a women dead. Her\n throat had been cut. Lying on her breast was a small child, a girl about a\n year old.\"\n\np. 118.\n\n\"Slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow, the cart\n jolting and the loads swaying. Boys ran along the line of oxen, encouraging\n them with shrill Tartar cries, and belaboring the beasts with sticks. In the\n carts, the women, veiled as is the Tartar way, held children in their arms.\n Wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they\n sought protection from the wind and cold. A few old men plodded along on foot.\n\n Across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown. The leading\n oxteam reached this barrier and halted. The gunmen and other ruffians \n concealed among the rocks opened fire. Women and children leaped and\n scrambled from the carts, screamed, ran and sought vainly for safety.\n\n This massacre was not complete. The Armenian soldiers in the near-by \n barracks, hearing the firing and the turmoil, hurried to the scene....\n That same day the abandoned Tartar quarter of Alexandropol was looted\n and completely destroyed.\"\n\np. 192.\n\n\"Great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding-places on the\n retreat of the Turks followed our army as it advanced....

(First and second paragraphs)\n\n\"Russian troops did terrible things in the Turkish villages...We Armenians \n did not spare the Tartars....If persisted in, the slaughtering of prisoners, \n the looting, and the rape and massacre of the helpless become commonplace \n actions expected and accepted as a matter of course.\n\n I have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground,\n in numbers, like the fallen leaves in a forest. They had been as helpless\n and as defenseless as sheep. They had not died as soldiers die in the\n heat of battle, fired with ardor and courage, with weapons in their hands,\n and exchanging blow for blow. They had died as the helpless must, with\n their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself.\"\n\np. 133 (first paragraph)\n\n\"In this movement we took with us three thousand Turkish soldiers who\n had been captured by the Russians and left on our hands when the Russians\n abandoned the struggle. During our retreat to Karaklis two thousand of\n these poor devils were cruelly put to death. I was sickened by the\n brutality displayed, but could not make any effective protest.

They were poor, and possessed few arms beyond knives.\n ...Shortly after the killing of the Tartars in our village, the revolution\n in Russia was suppressed.\"\n\np. 97 (third paragraph)\n\n\"Within a few years, following the beginning of the movement, an invisible\n government of Armenians by Armenians had been established in Turkish \n Armenia in armed opposition to the Turkish Government. This secret \n government had its own courts and laws and an army of assassins called\n 'Mauserists' (professional killers) to enforce its decrees.\"\n\np. 98 (first paragraph)\n\n\"The Dashnacks were in continual open rebellion against the Turkish \n Government.\"\n\np. 98 (third paragraph)\n\n\"...the Dashnacks engineered a general revolt of Armenians in Turkish\n Armenia under the mistaken belief that European nations would intervene\n and secure independence for Turkish Armenia.\"\n\np. 99 (second paragraph)\n\n\"The Dashnacks were fanatics.\"           \n\np. 99 (third paragraph)\n\n\"The Dashnacks took advantage of this situation and extended their \n revolutionary activities into the Russian province. They instituted \n a campaign of terrorism and employed threats and force in securing\n contributions to the party funds from rich Armenians. A wealthy\n man would be assessed a stipulated sum. Refusal to pay brought upon\n him a sentence of death. \n\n Every member of the party was pledged to carry out orders without \n question. If a man were to be assassinated, lots might be drawn to\n select an executioner or the job might be assigned to one of the\n 'mauserists' of the party.\"\n\np. 130 (first paragraph)\n\n\"...in moments of victory against Turks and Kurds or Tartars, they \n [Armenians] have been remorseless in seeking vengeance.\"\n\np. 130 (third paragraph)\n\n\"The city was a scene of confusion and terror. During the early days of \n the war, when the Russian troops invaded Turkey, large numbers of the \n Turkish population abandoned their homes and fled before the Russian \n advance.\"\n\np. 159 (second paragraph)\n\n\"I made a cannon, a huge gun to lift which required four men. I made balls\n for it. With my cannon the Armenians could knock down any of the Tartar\n houses and so they were able to drive the Tartars out.\"\n\np. 181 (first paragraph)\n\n\"The Tartar villages were in ruins.\"\n\np. 189 (third paragraph)\n\n\"The dead Tartar lay with his head in a pool of mud and blood, his \n beard still setaceous and now crimsoned.\"\n\nSerdar Argic", "label": 17}

{"text": "These are MY last words on the subject\n\n\n\n\nSome people think it enhances the flavor.  I personally don't think it\nhelps the taste, it makes me sick, so I try to avoid it.\n\n\n\nWell, I know that MSG effects ME adversely - maybe not permanently but\nat least temporarily enough that I like to try to avoid the stuff.\n\n\n\nEXCUSE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nWhy can't people learn to cook from scratch *ON* the net.  I've gotten\nLOTS of recipes off the net that don't use additives.\n\nIf you LIKE additives then get off the net and go to your local\nsupermarket, buy lots of packaged foods, and YOU get OFF THE NET!!\n\n\nI don't!!\n\n\nHEY - I'll pay *MY* hard earned dollars to buy food that costs more\nbut does NOT have preservatives.  I choose to speak with my pocketbook\nin many ways.\n\n\n\nNacho cheese Doritos, breading for MANY frozen fried foods (like fish\nand chicken), etc. ad naseum.\n\n\nOr the \"and other natural flavorings syndrome.\"  It's been a few years\nsince I've bought anything labelled with \"and other natural\nflavorings\".  \n\n\n\nWell, I had had similar reactions many times.  That was when I really\nstarted WATCHING CAREFULLY - reaction to Doritos - hey guess what's in\nthere - reaction to Lawry's season salt - guess what's in THERE\n\nI'll give you a hint - I've had enough problems with MANY MANY MANY\ndifferent products with MSG that I figured out one thing.\n\nUNLESS I plan on getting sick - I won't eat the stuff without my\nSeldane.  And did I ever learn to read labels.\n\n\nWhich was why I started checking EVERY time I got sick.  And EVERY\ntime I got sick MSG was somehow involved in one of the food products.\nAnd consider there were no other similar ingredients (to my knowledge)\n- it might not please a medical researcher - but it pleased my own\npersonal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and MOST\nIMPORTANTLY it's enough proof for ME to avoid it (and enough proof\nthat my INCREDIBLY frugal fiance didn't flinch when I literally threw\nout or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg -\nand he always flinches when there's waste - but it was a simple\nexplanation - I won't eat this stuff, I WON'T cook with this stuff, so\nI can either throw it out or give it away.)\n\n\n\nProbably Lawry's seasoning salt.  I LOVE the way that tastes.  \n\nI'm not saying I NEVER consume ANYTHING with MSG.  I've noticed that I\nhave a certain tolerance level - like a (small) bag of bbq chips once\na month or so it not a problem - but that same bag of chips will\nbother me if I also had chicken bouillon yesterday and lunch at one of\nthe Chinese restaurants the day before.  \n\n\n\nBut - some say that only 2% of the population has a problem with MSG -\nsome say it's more like 20% - but let's say that it's 5%.  How many\npeople would have to be tested that would have a problem?  Also - I\nKNOW I have a problem with it, and I wouldn't VOLUNTEER for a test.\nLike thanks guys but I don't WANT to get sick.  Also - I'm sure that\nmost people probably have varying degrees of sensitivities at\ndifferent times.  If I have a cold I'm MUCH more susceptible to the\nreaction than when I'm healthy (as proven today - when I'm stuffy but\nfor some silly reason I still gave in and decided to have the BBQ\nchips ;}).\n\n\n\nCathy doesn't - I haven't saved all my postings but I NEVER called it\n\"chinese restaurant syndrome\" and I NEVER stated I got it only from\nChinese food.  I just thought it would be easiest to conduct my\npersonal test at a Chinese take out place that I knew would hold (or\nnot hold) the MSG.  I can't call up whoever makes Doritos and ask them\nto make me ONE back of chips without MSG.\n\n\nWell, I believe I mentioned that in an earlier post \n\nLet's see you wrote this message at\n\nDate: 20 Apr 1993 00:09:31 -0500\n\nbut on \n\nDate: 19 Apr 1993 16:33:18 GMT\n\n\n\n\nOH - and just in case anyone thinks I'm prejudice against either\nChinese food or Asian people - I'm not going home to cook some Chinese\nfood for the guy I'm marrying next week.

{"text": "\n[Stuff deleted]\n \n\n\nWill, there has been a lot of discussion going on about this over in\ns.r.c.b-s.\nI will make the case here though and try to help you out:\n\n8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it\nis the gift of God:\n9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.\n(Ephesians 2:8-9).\n\nYes, it is by God's grace and our faith that we are saved.  We are not\nsaved by what we do.  However,\n\n15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.\n(John 14:15).\n\nKeeping Christ's commandments is a \"work\" per se, and a demonstration of\nour love for him.  Also,\n\n6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his\nvineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.\n7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years\nI come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why\ncumbereth it the ground?\n8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I\nshall dig about it, and dung it:\n9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it\ndown.\n(Luke 13:6-9).\n\nAgain,\n\n16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye\nshould go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that\nwhatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.\n(John 15:16).\n\nIt is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit. \nWhat is that fruit.  Well, Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being\nlove, joy, peace, patience, etc.  All of these are things that are manifest\nin the actions that we carry out.\n\nIf a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ, but does not do the things\nChrist commanded, I dare say, that they really don't have any faith. \nAsking which is more important, faith or works, is like asking which blade\non a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your\npants is more important.\n\nGood works should come out of and be a result of our faith.  To have faith,\ntrue faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands.  The parable\nabove speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit.  Christs\ncommands are actions, and if we don't do those actions and produce fruit,\nthen we shall be uprooted just like the tree. \n\nIt is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions\nprove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  I can sit and talk for\ndays about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off a\nbuilding and not hit the ground.  In other words, I can sit and tell you\nall day long that I have faith in my ability to fly.  I really don't have\nthat faith though unless I am willing to jump off the roof and take the\ntest.  Words and talk mean nothing.\n\nI could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to I will, but\nthis should be sufficient.\n\nHope it helped.\n\nJon\n\n----------------\nsig file broken....\n\nplease try later...", "label": 15}

Paul begins\nRomans 14 with \"If someone is weak in the faith ...\" Do you count\nyourself as one who is weak in the faith?\n\n\nYes, but what does the Bible have to say? What did Jesus say?

Is there any doubt in your mind\nabout what is right and what is sin (Greek hamartia = missing the mark)?\n\n\nWhereas, the Ten Commandments and Jesus' words in Matt5:14-19 are fairly\nclear, are they not?\n\n\nMatt5:14-19 doesn't answer your question?\n\n\nBreaking bread - roughly synonymous with eating.\n\n\nHow do you unite this concept of yours with the Ten Commandments and\nJesus's word in Matt5:14-19?\n\n\nOr, they assumed that the Ten Commandments and Jesus' word in\nMatt5:14-19 actually stood for something? Perhaps they were \"strong in\nthe faith?\"\n\n---------------------------\n\n[No, I don't believe that Paul can overrule God.  However Paul was\nwriting for a largely Gentile audience.  The Law was regarded by Jews\nat the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There\nare rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic\nlaws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to\nface after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to\nfollow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't say\nthat the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it\ndidn't apply to Gentiles.  Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 5.\nAs far as I can tell, both Paul and other Jewish Christians did\ncontinue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath.  Thus they\ncontinued to obey the Law.  The issue was (and is) with Gentile\nChristians, who are not covered by the Law (or at least not by the\nceremonial aspects of it).\n\nJesus dealt mostly with Jews.  I think we can reasonably assume that\nMat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience.  He did interact with\nGentiles a few times (e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and a\ncouple of others).  The terms used to describe the centurion (see Luke\n7) suggest that he was a \"God-fearer\", i.e. a Gentile who followed\nGod, but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law.  He was commended by\nJewish elders as a worthy person, and Jesus accepted him as such.\nThis seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view\nthat Gentiles need not accept the Law.\n\nHowever there's more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul on\nthe Law.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we\nhave to come to grips with Paul's apparent rejection of the Law, and\nhow that relates to Jesus' commendation of the Law.  At least as I\nread Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a\ncertain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn't one of the\nabolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes\nthat he might be understood this way, and assures us that that's not\nwhat he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being\npresent to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it's an\nimpossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ.\nPaul's comments are not the world's clearest here, and not everyone\nagrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that\neven this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law.\nIt still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota\nor dot may be removed.  For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's\nimportant that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it's not\nthe end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.\n\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\nLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,\nbut in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\nPaul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\n\"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\n\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\nresponding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\nof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\nto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and\nhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later\nto give Paul so much trouble.\n\nIt's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but\nwe should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the\nway terms like \"family values\" take on special meaning from the\ncurrent context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to\nfigure out why \"family values\" should be used as a code word for\nopposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I\nthink Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was\ninvolved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values\nthat go along with the term \"Law\", any more than people who concerned\nabout the \"family values\" movement are really opposed to family\nvalues.", "label": 15}

{"text": " (excerpts from posting on this topic) \n\n\n(I've seen satellites at midnight - they're not only in twilight.) :o) \n\n\nNow my comments: \n\nI'd like to add that some of the \"protests\" do not come from a strictly \npractical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for \nresearch activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I \nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \nin an afterlife.  \n\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \n\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \none weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \nmiles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters \nmuch either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \n\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't \nfouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - \nlike, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch \ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \nIf ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \n\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it \nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \neven if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. ", "label": 14}

A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks\n  (similar to today's checking system except entirely digital) may\n  be one approach.  The issues of cryptography, privacy, and\n  anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an\n  economy.  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum\n  (~Dec.1992).\n\n  An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus\n  <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU> based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the\n  cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to\n  elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:\n\n    ::\n    command: help\n    \n    user@host\n\n  where `user@host' is your email address.\n \n  \n_____\n<5.2> What is a ``hacker'' or ``cracker''?\n\n  These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning,\n  especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past\n  a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as\n  breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most\n  internet users prefer the term ``cracker'' for this.  Instead, a\n  ``hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,\n  curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a\n  system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and\n  patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also\n  the ``Hacker's Dictionary'' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq'.\n \n \n_____\n<5.3> What is a ``cypherpunk''?\n\n  From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:\n\n  > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were\n  > more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy\n  > must create it for themselves and not expect governments,\n  > corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant\n  > them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people\n  > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,\n  > envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek\n  > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or\n  > their opinions.\n\n  See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.\n\n  See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary\n  in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks.\n\n_____\n<5.4> What is `steganography' and anonymous pools?\n\n  Closely associated with encryption is `steganography' or the\n  techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication\n  but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself. \n  Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the\n  proliferation of computer technology.  For example, it is possible\n  to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,\n  typically the most 'noisy'. In addition, when such an item is\n  posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually\n  untraceable  communication can take place between sender and\n  receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic\n  realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where\n  individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual\n  users decode particular messages with their unique key.   An\n  anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman\n  (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to\n  <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following\n  commands in the subject line:\n\n    subscribe\n    unsubscribe\n    help\n\n_____\n<5.5> What is `security through obscurity'?\n\n  `Security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain\n  protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information\n  or programs relating to them.  For example, a company may not make\n  public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade\n  `attacks' based on knowledge of it. Another example would be\n  concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in\n  operating systems.  Or, some reliance may be made on the fact that\n  some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious\n  because they are ``not widely known'' or ``not widely used.'' This\n  argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet\n  posting `forgery'. `Security through obscurity' is regarded as a\n  very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at\n  worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach''). See the FAQ\n  for alt.security.  \n  \n  Some remarks of John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic\n  Frontier Foundation, directed to NSA agents at the First\n  International Symposium on National Security & National\n  Competitiveness held in McLean, Virginia  Dec. 1, 1992:\n\n  > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep\n  > contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It's\n  > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If\n  > something hits the Net and it's something which people on there\n  > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  I\n  > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into\n  > an environment where any information which is at all interesting\n  > to people is going to get out.  And there will be very little\n  > that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view,\n  > but you may differ...\n\n_____\n<5.6> What are `identity daemons'?\n  \n  RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to\n  query a remote user's login name after connection to a local\n  communication socket (a connection of this type is established\n  during FTP and TELNET sessions, for example).  The standard is not\n  widely supported, perhaps 10% of internet sites currently implement\n  it but the number is increasing.  The mechanism is detrimental to\n  anonymity.  Regular users cannot disable it but system\n  adminstrators can circumvent it.  This standard may represent a\n  trend toward greater authentication mechanisms.\n\n_____\n<5.7> What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy?\n\n\n  Remailing/Posting\n  -----------------\n  \n  - Stable, secure, protected, officially sanctioned and permitted,\n    publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs.\n  - Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET\n    postings.\n  - Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information\n    obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining,\n    encrypted addresses, etc.)\n  - Standards for anonymous email addressing, embedding files, and\n    remailer site chaining.\n  \n  General\n  -------\n  \n  - Recognition of anonymity, cryptography, and related privacy\n    shields as legitimate, useful, desirable, and crucial by the\n    general public and their governments.\n  - Widespread use and implementation of these technologies \n    by systems designers into\n    hardware, software, and standards, implemented `securely,'\n    `seamlessly,' and `transparently'.\n  - General shift of use, dependence, and reliance to means other than\n    wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement\n    agencies.\n  - Publicity, retraction, and dissolution of laws and government\n    agencies opposed to privacy, replaced by structures dedicated to\n    strengthening and protecting it.\n\n\nISSUES\n======\n\n_____\n<6.1> What is the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)?\n\n  From ftp.eff.org:/pub/EFF/mission_statement:\n\n  > A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic\n  > media which connect us.

The group has three offices (Palo Alto, Cambridge,\n  Washington, DC) and 20 chapters. It is involved in  litigation\n  against the FBI, The NSA, NIST, the Secret Service and other other\n  U.S. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation\n  on issues such as Operation Sundevil, the FBI wiretap proposal,\n  NSA's interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in\n  Arlington, Va in Nov 1992. Members speak frequently in front on\n  Congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to\n  testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and\n  caller identification.\n\n  CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available\n  via FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising\n  the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.  For\n  more information, anonymous FTP  cpsr.org:/cpsr/.\n\n\n  (Thanks to Dave Banisar <banisar@washofc.cpsr.org> for contributions\n  here.)\n\n_____\n<6.3> What was `Operation Sundevil' and the Steve Jackson Game case?\n\n  In the early 1990's a fear spread among U.S. law enforcement agencies\n  on the illicit activities of `hackers' and `phreakers' involved in\n  such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery.\n  \n  (see ftp.eff.org:/pub/SJG/General_Information/EFFector1.04):\n\n  > `Operation Sundevil,' the Phoenix-inspired crackdown of May\n  > 8,1990, concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card\n  > abuse, and followed this seizure plan with some success. \n  > [Bulletin Board Systems] went down all over America, terrifying\n  > the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of\n  > their criminal instruments.

The movement reached a\n  crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal\n  search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of\n  Austin Texas on March 1, 1990.  From the column GURPS' LABOUR LOST\n  by Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> in Fantasy and Science\n  Fiction Magazine:\n\n  > In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional\n  > warrant, agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the\n  > SJG office.

Yet Jackson and his business were not only\n  > innocent of any crime, but never suspects in the first place. \n  > The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that\n  > somewhere in Jackson's office there `might be' a document\n  > compromising the security of the 911 telephone system.\n\n  FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed\n  on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier\n  Foundation.  See information on EFF below.

Its users scarcely noticed, for\n  > ARPANET's  functions not only continued but steadily improved. \n  > The use of  TCP/IP standards for computer networking is now\n  > global.  In 1971, a  mere twenty-one years ago, there were only\n  > four nodes in the  ARPANET  network.  Today there are tens of\n  > thousands of  nodes in  the Internet,  scattered over forty-two\n  > countries, with more coming  on-line every day.   Three million,\n  > possibly four million people use  this gigantic\n  > mother-of-all-computer-networks.   \n  > \n  > The Internet is especially popular among scientists, and is \n  > probably the most important scientific instrument of the late \n  > twentieth century.   The  powerful, sophisticated access that it \n  > provides to specialized data and personal communication  has sped\n  > up the pace of scientific research enormously.  \n  > \n  > The Internet's pace of growth in the early 1990s is  spectacular, \n  > almost ferocious.  It is spreading faster than cellular phones,\n  > faster  than fax machines.  Last year the Internet was growing at\n  > a rate of  twenty percent a *month.*  The number of `host'\n  > machines with direct  connection to TCP/IP has been doubling\n  > every year since  1988.

The author is committed\n  to keeping this up-to-date and strengthening it, but this can only\n  be effective with your feedback.  In particular, the following\n  items are sought:\n  \n  - Short summaries of RFC documents and other references listed,\n    esp. CPSR files.\n  - More data on the specific uses and penetration of RFC-931.\n  - Internet traffic statistics.  How much is email?  How much\n    USENET?  What are the costs involved?\n  - Famous or obscure examples of compromised privacy\n    on the internet.\n        - FTP site for the code (NOT the code) to turn the .plan file into a\n                named pipe for sensing/reacting to remote `fingers'.\n  - Knowledge on the `promiscuous' mode of receipt or transmission \n    on network  cards.\n  - Details on the infamous experiment where a scientist resubmitted \n    previously accepted papers to a prominent journal with new and\n    unknown authors that were subsequently rejected.\n  - X Windows, EFF, CPSR FAQhood in news.answers.\n  \n  Commerical use of this document is negotiable and is a way for the\n  author to recoup from a significant time investment.

{"text": "Thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and I am looking at using a\ncouple of the ideas. I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.\nspec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C\nand sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time\ndelay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this\napplication, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger\npins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is\ndisabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.\nWhen triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x\nthe timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can\nbe programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting\nany combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it\nis, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K\nresistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of\n2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)\nOf course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for\n256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.\nAfter the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14\nday timing cycle and so forth.\n\nPower is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the\nelectronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet\npuker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to\nkeep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to\nwork for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts\nto spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see\nwhat I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that\nhas to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns\noff ;-)\n\nThanks again everyone...", "label": 12}

The misadventure began on Feb. 28 when\n100 agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, To-\nbacco and Firearms storemd the compound, intent\non seizing Koresh and a cache of automatic weap-\nons.

If the Lebanese army can control these \nelements then I think we can see genuine peace on the Israel-Lebanese border.\nI remind you that a couple thousand Lebanese cross each day into Israel to \nwork.\nAs for the election of Bashir Gemayel, it is true that he was favorable to\nIsrael, is that why the Syrians killed him?

{"text": "\nThat doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something\nthey can get caught at.  And key size is one of the things that can be\nverified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the\nchip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the\noutput.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output\nbits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.\n\nIf they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that\nsome of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that\nthey only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,\nDES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output\nchange rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think\nNSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.\n\nRemember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see\nthe cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased\nsubkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The committee\ncan and should run lots of tests, and retain the output.  This can be verified\nlater against the chip.  And yes, the civilian community has at least some\nsecure storage facilities that I don't think even NSA can get into without\nit being noticed, until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again.\n(Oops -- I don't think I was supposed to talk about that...)  The committee\nmembers can even retain secure copies of the code -- in two halves, which\nyou have to XOR together to recover the program...\n\nSeriously, there are, I think, problems with this whole scheme.  But the\npeople who invented it aren't stupid, and they've been in the crypto game\nand the smoke-and-mirrors game far longer than most of us.  They're not\ngoing to lie in ways that can be detected easily, since their credibility\nis the *only* thing they can use to sell this system.  If they've lied\nabout the civilian committee, no one will believe them about the absence\nof other back doors.  If they've lied about the key size, no one will\nbelieve that they haven't copied the programming disk with the U keys.\nIf they've lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem,\nno one will believe the escrow agencies aren't in cahoots with them.\n\nThat isn't to say that they aren't lying about all those other things\nanyway.  And I'm certainly not claiming that NSA can't build a cryptosystem\nwith a back door that the committee can't find -- look how long it took\nfor folks to believe that the S-boxes weren't sabotaged.  It's entirely\npossible that the committee will release an ambiguous report, for just\nsuch reasons.  But that's a subtle point (i.e., one you can't explain to\na Senator...).\n\n\nI don't like the unit key generation process any better than you do.\nHowever -- S1 and S2 are supposed to be under control of the same\nescrow agents.  If they can't be trusted to keep the seed values secure,\nthey can't be trusted to keep the half-keys secure.\n\nI still don't know if or when S1 and S2 change.

Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain \nknowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read the\nBible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and\nthere exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond\nour shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself  \nto seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a\nperson who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find \nsomething to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one\nwill gain with that attitude is folly.\n\nBe careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages\nin the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even\nthough they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not.\nBe assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such\ndeep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied. \nI will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, \"You will never\nbe thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over.\"\n\n\nFrom King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):\n\n    \"It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;\n     to search out a matter is the glory of kings.\"\n\n\nJesus says in John 6:44 & 55:\n\n   \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.\"\n\n\nAnd in John 3:16:\n\n   \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,\n   that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal\n   life.\"\n\n\nYou are included in \"whosoever\".  And I also pray that the Father is\ndrawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn't be posting\nto talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the\nmaking.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure\nstoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became\non of the most celebrated men in the history of God's church.\n\nYou see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because\nyou could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack\nChristians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul,\nproclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.\n\nOr you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would \nprobably say to you: \"Satan would surely like to have you.\"  Why so?\nBecause Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great\nmoments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task\nhe did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have the\nfaith to walk on water as Jesus did.\n\nYou asked \"Why not believe in Zeus?\"  Zeus didn't offer eternal life.\nYou got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus.\n", "label": 19}

{"text": "anyone else experiencing a similar problem?\n\nThis concerns the clutch on a 92 Honda Accord 5 speed. When the clutch\nis first used in the morning, about the first 4 miles of shifting, there\nis a significant amount of clutch chatter until things warm up.  Then the\nclutch shifts smoothly.  This chatter started when I moved to the San \nFrancisco Bay area from a low-humidity environment.  The dealer stated\nthat this is known to happen since Honda changed from an asbestos to\nnon-asbestos clutch material.  No remedy!!

{"text": "I am doing research on atheism, part of which involves field research here\non the net.  The following is a survey directed towards all readers of this\ngroup, intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief.  I would\nseriously appreciate it if each and every one of you would fill it out and\nmail it back to me at mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu.  \n\nFirst of all, I've tried to structure questions that can be answered in a\nvariety of ways, with varying amounts of detail; it's possible to give \nsuccinct answers to most everything, but there's enough here to keep most of \nyou typing for hours, I'm sure.  As much detail as you want to give me (I mean \nit) is great, but it's also important for me to have as broad a base of \nindividuals as possible, so even minimal responses are far better than nothing\n-- it's a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration.  \n\nSecondly, I hope some of the questions don't come off as obnoxious; I know that\nphrases like \"What would convince you of the existence of God\" imply that I am\na seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant Godless heathens.\nIn fact, I'm not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself, so my\nuse of \"God\" is a question of locution rather than ideology -- it's easier \nthan just repeating \"a deity or higher power\" every time.  \n\nAlso, I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like \"belief system\"\nalthough I know some of you might contend that you don't have ANY beliefs, but\nare skeptical towards everything.  I understand; but you know what I mean.\nThink of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases \nrequired to get the precise idea across.  \n\nLastly, thanks!  Please fill out as much as you can, in as much detail as\nyou can, and send them to me.  My research and I thank you.  \n\n---------------\n\nWhere would you place your beliefs, on the spectrum \n\tTheism <--> Agnosticism <--> Weak Atheism <--> Strong Atheism?  \nFeel free to elaborate on your specific beliefs.  \n\n\nIn what, if any, religious tradition were you raised?  Did you ever believe \nin the existence of a God?  (Several of the following questions presume \nthat the answer to this is \"yes;\" if you've always been an atheist, or at\nleast never a theist, you may have to modify the question/answer somewhat.)\n\n\nHow serious was your/your family's involvement?  \n\nHow and when did you start to doubt the tenets you were raised to believe?  \n\nHow and when did your \"final break\" with your beliefs, if any, occur?  I \nrealize that this is often more of an ongoing process than an \"event\" per se;\nwhatever the case, just describe it in whatever detail you wish.  \n\n\nWhat contact with other atheists have you had; before and after (and during)\nyour \"conversion\" to atheism?  (Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism\ncounts -- how have net discussions affected your beliefs?)  \n\nTo what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in your\nbeliefs?  Did you come by your beliefs through discussion, through\nindependent means, or by some combination of the two or other means?  \n\n\nAre you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational\nmeans (proofs of the non-existence of God, etc), or was it perhaps, at least \nin part, through other means (alienation from mainstream religion, etc)?  \n\n\nTo what extent do you feel you \"understand\" the universe through your beliefs?\nWhat phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything from physical\nphenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs) do you \nfeel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs, and where are they lacking as \nan explanatory method?  \n\nWhat would it take for you to question, or change, your beliefs?  What would\nconvince you of the existence of God, what would convince you of the \nplausibility of God's existence, and so forth?  How dynamic are your beliefs\n-- are they constantly changing; have they stayed more or less the same for\nsome time?  \n\nAre you involved in a career or education in science?  To what extent do you\nthink science has influenced your beliefs?  (Issac Asimov claimed that science\nwas the new \"secular religion,\" and that \"scientists are, in a very real sense,\nthe new priesthood.\"  Do you see the pursuit of science as having a quasi-\nreligious base, or even a religious element?)  \n\n---------------\n\nThis survey is intended to get data from a broad range of individuals, but\nalso to help me narrow down the field to a small group of people whose\nideas and histories could be very useful to me.  Would you be willing to have\nme, on the basis of this survey, write you to find out more about you and your\nbeliefs?  If not, fine; your filling out the survey alone is great.  \n\n---------------\n\nThanks again.

My wife and I picked this game to go to\nand thus caused the return of the pre-season-projected Sox\noffense.  Like all no-no's Bosio was good, lucky (hard grounder\nby Vaughn off T. Martinez' glove but straight to Boone who \nthrew to Bosio at first, 3-4-1), and backed by good defense\n(many non-trivial groundouts).  The game was amazingly fast,\nas the Sox tended to go down quickly and Hesketh was also \nworking fast.  The Sox relief pitching was ok -- the runs off\nQuantrill were on two ridiculous bloops and a hard line single\nwhich Greenwell let get past him trying for a catch.\n\nGreenwell's mental stability is a serious concern (I guess it\nhas always been, but his quirks were amusing back when he was\nan MVP candidate).  Wednesday he got in a huff with Johnson a\nafter striking out on a bad inside pitch (apparently Johnson\nmade an \"ok, I've got to stay focused\" gesture which Iron Mike\ninterpreted as taunting), and struck out to heavy booing the \nnext two times.  As Valentine noted, last night he came up in\nthe first after Riles and Quintana had walked to open the game.\nCan you say \"take the first pitch\"?  Not Mike, who dribbled it\ninto a 6-4-3.  The PI quoted Bosio that this was a \"batting\npractice fastball\".  Next time up he also hit the first pitch,\na hard liner straight to KGJr in center.  He also made the\npathetic error and failed to catch Boone's HR (which looked \ncomparable to the ball Lance Johnson caught on the highlight\nreel that night).\n\nIs Riles suppsoed to be good defensively?

{"text": "\nI have this same alarm installed in my Syclone.  It works great.  The shock\nsensor is very sensitive, but much more practical than the motion sensor I have\non my other car.  It doesn't trigger if the car is rocked gently by the wind,\nbut any kind of shock sets it off.  Even kicking the tire sets it off.  It\nworks great.\n\n\nThe shock sensor is adjustable and there are two cycles on it.  You can adjust\nit to be sensitive enough that there is no way you could open the hood without\nsetting off the alarm.  Although, I know that you cannot pop the hood on the\nSyclone without setting off my alarm now, and yet I have had zero (none!) false\nalarms with this system.  The alarm tells you when you disarm it whether it has\nbeen activated in your absence.  I have been able to trace every alarm to it's\ncause and it was not a false alarm.\nI guess it would be possible depending on the vehicle.  My Syclone is so tight\nin the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this.  There are\nsupplemental power supplies you can put on with this Viper alarm, but I don't\nhave one.  I really think that if someone wants my car that bad, the alarm\nwon't keep them from it, even with a supplemental power supply.\n\nThis is primarily for convertibles.  I have a convertible and have looked at\nthis feature in detail.  Alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you want\nto get one of these.  It has zones in it that can be shut down independently so\nthat if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else that\nwould trigger an alarm, it shuts down the zone, or rather, pulls it in tighter.\nI don't see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that you\nleave the top down on.\n\nAvoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package.  It talks to\npeople as they walk by.  I saw one installed on a Lotus Esprit.  The kids would\ntaunt it seeing how close they could get before it 'warned' them to get back. \nThe owner finally disabled it, which defeats the purpose in my mind.\nI am real happy with my Viper.  One other feature I really like is you can tune\nit to your preferences.  You can have it arm passively or not.  You can disable\nthe chirp for arming/disarming.  You can have it lock/unlock the doors when the\nalarm is armed/disarmed.  \n\nI like these features.  I hate the chirp when the alarm arms/disarms, so mine\nflashes the lights only.  I like the door lock feature, although I have to be\ncareful to take my keys with me because it doesn't know if you have left your\nkeys in the car when it passively arms and locks the doors.  But, if you are\nmeticulous about taking your keys with you, it takes care of the rest.\n\nI looked seriously at the Alpine system too.  It is a real nice system, but\nmore money and it has a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor. \nThe shock sensor is better....and the Viper shock sensor is better (2 cycle)\nthan the optional Alpine one, IMHO.  I think the Viper gives you a lot of good\nvalue for the money.  But it isn't absolutely tamperproof.  No system is. \nExcept maybe the one that James Bond had on his Lotus in For Your Eyes Only. \nAnyone know where we can get one of those installed?  Maybe that was what they\nhad in the van in the World Trade Center, huh?>\n", "label": 7}

{"text": "Subject: Re: Eugenics\n/\n;Probably within 50 years, a new type of eugenics will be possible. \n;Maybe even sooner.  We are now mapping the human genome.  We will \n;then start to work on manipulation of that genome.  Using genetic\n;engineering, we will be able to insert whatever genes we want.\n;No breeding, no \"hybrids\", etc.  The ethical question is, should\n;we?\n \nTwo past problems with eugenics have been \n1) reducing the gene pool and \n2) defining the status of the eugenized.\n \nInserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted\ngenes later became transmissible to progeny. Then they may be able to\ncrowd out \"garbage genes.\" This may in the future become possible. Even if\nit does, awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully\nmean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy\nlater. Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa\nand for diabetes in the Hopi *promoted* survival in some conditions. We\ndon't really know what the future may hold for our environment. The\nreduced wilderness- and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred\ndomesticated animals comes to mind. Vulcanism, nuclear winter, ice age,\nmeteor impact, new microbiological threats, famine, global warming, etc.,\netc., are all conceivable. Therefore, having as many genes as possible\navailable is a good strategy for species survival. \n \nOf course, the status of genetically altered individuals would start out\nas no different than anyone else's. But if we could make\n\"philosopher-kings\" with great bodies and long lives, would we (or they)\nwant to give them elevated status? We could. The Romans did it with their\nkings *without* the benefits of such eugenics. The race eventually\nrealized and dealt with the problems which that caused, but for a while,\nit was a problem. Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen\nto persons genetically altered for more menial tasks. But there is nothing\nnew under the sun. We treated slaves the same way for millennia before\n\"1984.\"   \n \nI see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2\nproblems. Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to\nuse any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time. That\nhasn't stopped the race as a whole yet. Many are the civilizations which\nhave died from inability to adapt to environmental change. However, also\nmany are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own\npower. The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the\nfates of others, and have survived by making better choices when their\nturns came.\n \nNot that I don't think that this gene altering power couldn't wipe us off\nthe face of the earth or cause endless suffering. Nuclear power or global\nwarming or whatever could and may still do that, too. \n \nThe real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue. I personally don't think\nman has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any\nbetter than he did the for last few. We, as eugenists, may make it, an we\nmay not. If we don't, I hope there are reservoirs of \"garbage\" people out\nin some backwater with otherwise long discarded \"garbage\" genes which will\npull us through. \n \nI believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same.\nMan needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his\nlacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has. Some men have,\nand I believe all men may, listen to and obey the still small voice of God\nin their hearts. This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue\nneeded to escape the problems consequent to poor choices. Peoples have\ndied out for many reasons. The societies which failed to accept enough\ninput from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed\nthemselves, and often others in the process. It is self-evident that the\nones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit\nto use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes\nthus far, or else haven't had enough power for long enough. \n \nIn summary, I would say that the question of whether to use this new\ntechnology is really an ancient one. And the answer, in some ways hard, in\nsome ways easy, is the same ancient answer. It isn't the power, it is the\nSpirit.\n \nSorry for the long post. Got carried away.", "label": 13}

Clearly, a crypto-strength hash like MD5 or the SHA would be\nstronger, but again, I'm not sure I'm comfortable claiming that it's\nunbreakable.\n \n   A scheme to use up some of the pad bits to decide how many bits of 0's\nto include in the plaintext stream before going on wouldn't be too bad,\neither.  At the cost of increasing the speed with which you use up your\npad, this could be used to give you arbitrarily low probability that your\nopponent could spoof a valid-looking message, since any deciphered plaintext\nin a spot that should be carrying 0's will show that something funny's going\non.\n \n   If, for each message bit M_i, we used up one random bit, R_i, to decide\nwhether to insert a 0 into the plaintext stream, we'd get a total pad use\nof 2.5 times the message length.  (We'd expand the message size by about\nhalf.)  Each 0 that should appear in the plaintext stream that doesn't is a\nguess for our would-be spoofer.  At each bit, she has to guess.  I'm trying\nto see how to quantify her chances of making it all the way through the\nspoofed message, but it gets a little complicated, because she can get un-\nsynched, and still happen to have a 0 in that place in the spoofed message.\n \n   Now, I can see a simple way of doing this that's got to be as secure\nas a one-time pad, at a cost of using 4 times the message length in pad bits.\n \n   For each message bit, M_i, use one random bit, R_i, and xor them together\nto get X_i.  Now, encrypt the three bits with the one-time pad.  The enemy\nhas no way of guessing what R_i is, so he/she can't guess what X_i is, either.\nAny change she makes in the ciphertext stream will have to involve a guess\nof what R_i was.  Is there any way to do this without using so many pad bits?\n \n   Spoofing the message is equivalent to correctly guessing as many random\nbits as there are bits in the message.  Clearly, this makes spoofing messages\njust as hard if you know the whole message text as if you know none of it.\nIn fact, it looks to me like this makes it just as hard to generate a spoofed\nmessage with the ciphertext as without it, but I'm not entirely sure about\nthat.\n \n   Is there an easier way of doing this that's provably as secure as the\none-time pad?", "label": 11}

Luna\nhas a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital\nsites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers\na source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,\nand shielding.

Or as the site\nof a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for\ndefending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is\nunlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.\nThe second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good\nenough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for\nconventional warfare again.

If he meant that whatever exists must\nhave been created, then he is open to the obvious retort that God\nexists, and so God must have been created.\n\nPerhaps your friend meant that we exist now but that there was a\ntime when we did not exist, and therefore something other than\nourselves must have brought us into existence. This seems plausible,\nbut an atheist might reply, \"So my parents engendered me. So what?\"\nHere your friend would have to explain why an infinite regress of\ncauses is not a satisfactory explanation. He would have some support\nfrom philosophers who are not ordinarily considered religious (Ayn\nRand, and some others who are in the tradition of Aristotle). Having\nargued for a First Cause, he would have to bridge the gap between\nsaid entity and the God of Abraham. If he merely asserts that the\nthings we observe are ultimately dependent on things radically\nunlike them, few physicists would disagree.", "label": 15}

If the \nreceiving chip detects a mismatch it must assume that the line is bad and \nit will cease to work; in your own interest you are protected from getting \nfaulty plaintext, you know -- it's just like a checksum for your own \nsafety ;-(. \n\nThe `monitoring agencies' won't have the famous black box which is needed \nfor actual decryption and will be kept by the FBI; but nothing prevents \nthem from using special boxes which will do the redundancy check for the \nserial number block and consistency checks on the embedded L.E. blocks \nwithin the transmission.

{"text": "\nGod never changes.  He still loves us.  Sending Jesus was one of His\nattempts to reconcile with mankind.  The nature of God has not changed.\n\n\nSinning in the face of God was punishable by immediate death.  There are\nseveral OT passages to back this up.  God is God.  He cannot tolerate\nthe prescence of sin in His midst.  And the Israelites knew this!  And\nstill, some of them chose to disobey and were destroyed.  Were these\npeople KIND and LOVing themselves?  God gave them every break He could\nbut in the end, He really had no choice in the matter.  Seeing as how\nwe were failing to achieve salvation on our own, He sent His Son to die\nfor us - to be the ultimate sin offering.  Now we live in the age of\ngrace.\n\n\n\nHe sent His Son as a consolation to us, out of love.\n \n\nHey, let's be fair for a moment here.  KIND and LOVING does not mean\na free ride.  There is an amount of give and take as in any relationship.\nParents are supposed to be kind and loving but does that mean that \nchildren can do whatever they want?  NOT!  Part of being a parent means\nadministering punishment when the child is at fault.  Part of being a \nparent means giving instruction.  God tests us through the trial of\nlife such that we may grow stronger.  He teaches what is right and \nwhat is wrong.  The consequences of our actions are made clear to us,\nbe it Heaven or be it Hell.  If God did not follow through with what\nHe has warned us about, He would not be a very good parent.\n\nIn parenting, if a parent issues a warning but does not follow through\nwith it, the children will not take that parent's words very seriously.\nGod does the same by telling us who have ears to hear what to do and\nwhat not to do.  By life's trials, we see the folly of doing our own\nwill rather than His.  He warns us about the consequences of rejecting\nHim when it comes time for Judgement.

Out of curiosity, I went to\nthe lecture.\n\nThere were four people there apart from the two Rosicrucians, one\nwoman and two men apart from me. The Rosicrucians were male, both of\nthem. First one of them told us about the Rosicrucians and Lectorium\nRosicrucianum, which was founded in Harlem, NL in 1925. He read\nstraight from a piece of paper, which I at that point was because he\nlacked experience in talking in front of people, but the other guy\nread, too, and he was used to holding speeches, I could tell. The\nfirst guy also said that the R:s are a mystical Christian order, and\nthat they base their teachings on the teachings of the Kathars\n(English?) from the thirteenth century.\n\nThe other guy took over, reading from his piece of paper in a\nfairy-tale teller's voice. What he said sounded like a load of crap to\nme. Of course that might be because I am unenlightened or something.\nWhat made me a bit suspicious, was the way they first said that we all\ncontained something divine, and could find our way back to divinity,\nthen that we couldn't become divine as the persons we are currently,\nbut if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss. Maybe I've\nread too much RAW, but it sounded very much like the things he talks\nabout in the chapter _How to robotize people and brainwash your\nfriends_ in _Prometheus rising_. \n\nIt was very interesting to watch the two Rosicrucians.

{"text": "\n\nWe here at IBM have the same problem with our workstations.  I was also\nshocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by\nabout 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only\n1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn't seem so bad.  What\nis happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due\nmainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but is\nmore like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end at\ndifferent x/y values, the \"ridges\" are out of phase, resulting in the\nstitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon\nright on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely see\na smeared effect where they overlap.\n  Example:\n  Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)\n      Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)\n\nYour implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick when\nrendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces\nwith isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as\nyou say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, the\nsystem does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the\napplication must do it.  This is what you have discovered and are doing.\nBravo!\n\n(Note to IBM'ers:  The information given here has been previously disclosed\nthrough proper channels so I'm not giving away any new unpublished info.)\n", "label": 1}
{"text": "\nAn interesting interpretation of Revelation 17 and 18 has been given by  \nevangelist David Wilkerson.  I am not saying that I totally agree with his  \ninterpretation, but it is certainly believable and good food for thought.  He  \ninterprets the Babylon of Revelation 17-18 as being none other than the good  \nold U. S. of A.  That's right, America.  He supports his claim in several ways.   \nThe Babylon of Revelation is THE world leader in trade and commerce, and the  \nWHOLE WORLD wept when Babylon fell.  The American dollar, despite the Japanese  \nsuccess of the 20th century, is STILL the most sought after currency in the  \nworld.  If the U.S. were destroyed, wouldn't the whole world mourn?  The bible  \nalso talks about Babylon being a home of harlots, sin, and adultery (I am  \nparaphrasing, of course).  Babylon's sin affected, or should I say, infected,  \nthe whole world.  It doesn't take much looking to see that the U.S. is in a  \nstate of moral decay.  Hasn't the American culture and Hollywood spread the \"do  \nit if it feels good\" mentality all over the world.  I think, though, that what  \nMr. Wilkerson uses as his strongest argument is the fact that Revelation calls  \nBabylon \"Babylon the Great\" and portrays it as the most powerful nation on  \nearth.

{"text": "From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: rejoinder. Questions to Israelis\n\n\nTo:  shaig@Think.COM\n\nSubject: Ten questions to Israelis\n\nDear Shai,\n\nYour answers to my questions are unsatisfactory.\n\nIn the answer to my first question, concerning the nonexistence of\nIsraeli nationality, your answer conflicts with information I have\nreceived from other quarters, according to which there are two\ndistinct categories of classifying Israelis:  Citizenship\n(Ezrahut) and Nationality (Le'um). The former is used on passports\netc, and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I\nam told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all\ntimes and present them at many public places, almost every day.\nThese ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab.\nYou maintain that this mainly because of religious services\nprovided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ?\nCould you provide evidence that this is the case and that it\nserves no other purpose ?\n\nIn the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that\nIsrael has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were\n'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. According to what I\nread, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had\nplans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into\nTransjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of\nBen-Gurion to not declare Israel's borders, when Israel was\nestablished, as this might restrict Israel's opportunities for\nlater expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the\nfact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the\nland to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God\npromised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the\nborders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use\ntoday ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can't it declare what\nit considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a\nbase for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one\ncannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a\nnumber of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).\n\nYour answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public\nofficial. I don't think your answer is honest.  You refer me to\nVanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without\nevaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said\nthe truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why\nshould he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.\n\nSomebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning\n'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from\nMa'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do\nexist in Israel. What do you think about that ?\n\nYou imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a\nway to 'cast aspersions upon Israel'. Such terms have often been\nused by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the Soviet\nUnion into disrepute. If my questions are not disturbing, they\nwould not call forth such hysterical answers. My questions are\nclearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. I would be\nvery happy if you could convince me that what I am told about\nIsrael were just fabrications, but alas you have failed to do so.\nI suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest\ndiscussion. This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.", "label": 17}

This impressive change in the province's ethnic character \n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \n (See also Map 1.

The main legal principles of the Turkish State \nare summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution:\n\n\t\"The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State\n\tgoverned by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public\n\tpeace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights;\n\tloyal to the nationalism of Ataturk, and based on the fundamental\n\ttenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution.\"\n\nFreedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire, allowing\nthe many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. The\nfact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be\nattributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written Constitution.\nThe first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856.\nAlthough the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force\nonly temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a Constitution.\n\nThe 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and\nthe right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitution\nof 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor, while increasing\nthe power of the Parliament and the government.\n\nThe First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By the\noccupation of Istanbul, the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was\nabolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the\noccupying forces.\n\nDuring the Independence War, the \"Turkish Grand National Assembly\" held their\nfirst meeting on April 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new\nTurkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish\nRepublic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 and the new\nConstitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal \nbackbone of today's modern Turkish Republic. In 1945, Turkey adopted a \nmulti-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by\nothers in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have been\nbased on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, national\nsovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization.\n\n\"Major Principles of the Constitution\"\n\nThe constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republic\nwithin the following principles:\n\n- The Turkish Republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by \n  law;\n- It should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice,\n  human rights and the objectives of Ataturk;\n- The language of the State is Turkish;\n- Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions.\n  Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation;\n- Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This\n  power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else;\n- Executive power is exercised by the President, and Council of Ministers;\n- Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the\n  Turkish nation;\n- All individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color,\n  sex, or political beliefs;\n- Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution.\n\n\"Structure of the State\"\n\nIn accordance with the Constitution, the structure of the state is based on the\nprinciple of \"division of power\" to create a balanced and self-controlled\nsystem. The power is divided into \"legislative power,\" \"executive power,\" and\n\"judicial power,\" balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each\nother (self-control).\n\n A. Legislative Power:\n\n The \"Turkish Grand National Assembly\" is a parliament with one House, elected\n by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on\n behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are:\n\n - to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws;\n - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers;\n - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers;\n - to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets;\n - to ratify international agreements;\n - to grant amnesty or pardons.\n\n Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral\n or written) during the course of their legislative duties. The country is\n divided into constituencies. The number of representatives of each is\n calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age\n of twenty-one can vote.\n\n Elections are supervised by the \"Supreme Council of Elections,\" which solves\n all disputes or appeals. In each province, the local \"Board of Election\"\n runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the\n Supreme Council. Members of the Council and Boards are elected among \n independent judges.\n\n B. Executive Power:\n\n The President of the Republic is the Head of State (not the head of government\n as in the Unites States). The main functions of the President are:\n\n - to represent the State and the Country;\n - to insure the implementation of the Constitution;\n - to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions;\n - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces;\n - to ratify laws and government decrees.\n \n The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven\n years. The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may \n call for a referendum.\n\n Executive power is exercised by the \"Council of Ministers,\" headed by the\n Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the\n members of Parliament. The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval\n by the President. The new Government (Council of Ministers) reads their\n program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows. There are 21 (?)\n Ministers in the Council.\n\n Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent\n \"administrative\" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or\n functions against any law.\n\n C. Judicial Power:\n\n Judicial power is exercised by independent courts. No authority or power can\n instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts. These cannot be \n discharged, replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the\n reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws. There are three categories\n of courts in the Turkish judiciary system:\n\n - Courts of justice deal with legal, commercial and criminal cases. The \n   decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice\n   upon the appeal of the parties involved.\n - The decisions or functions of the executive power (including the Prime\n   Minister and Ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in\n   administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law.\n   The decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the\n   high administrative court.\n\n The laws and decisions of the Grand National Assembly can be examined by the\n \"Constitutional Court\" if they contradict the Constitution. If found\n contradictory, this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the Parliament.\n\n\nSerdar Argic", "label": 17}

The Greeks started massacring \nthe Turkish population on Cyprus in 1974. In 1974, Turkiye stepped into \nCyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population there. This is \nnothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately, the intervention \nwas too late at least for some of the victims. Mass graves containing \nnumerous bodies of women and children already showed what fate had been \nplanned for a peaceful minority.\n\nThe people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots \nwill never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain \neternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the \ncost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was \nthe sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops \non July 15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of \nArchibishop Makarios.\n\nThe release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization\nof Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the\n'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not\nforget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks\nin Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to\ndestroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of\ncourse, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences \nfor this irresponsible conduct.\n\nTurkish Cypriots are simply seeking guarantees that will preclude a\nrepeat performance by the fanatical cadres of the Greeks' EOKA. If \nsuch assurances are not perfectly implemented, there is every reason \nto expect that the local Greeks will be misguided enough to perpetrate \ntheir past mistakes. On such an occasion, the Turkish side may not find \nit satisfactory to act with reluctance to go any further than before, \nfor it is unacceptable to remain always defensive against cyclical \nvicious attacks. Therefore it would be better to have a true federation\nof two separate sections living in obligatory peace, rather than another \narmed confrontation that would be started by the Greeks and obligatorily \nbut decisively terminated by the Turks. \n\nThe present Greek government is trying to tyrannize the Turkish population \nin western Thrace by forbidding it its ethnic and religious rights, which \nwere established through international treaties. One might be better\nadvised to remember that misadventures against Turkiye do not serve \nGreece well.\n\nAn offer of membership in the European Common Market as bait for concessions \nthat may doom the Turks in Cyprus to extinction is not a viable course for \nGreece or her friends. Neither Turkish lives nor Turkish honor has been \nplaced on the bidding block to be sold for commercial gain.\n\n\nSerdar Argic", "label": 17}

If you really want Tom to reply\nyou should send mail to support@qdeck.com.\n\nA 64k line is certainly going to restrict you far more than the 10mbps\nethernet that we typically run.  How restrictive it will be depends on \nwhat you run and how you run it.  I would think that a couple of instances\nof some really nasty program like \"Smoking Clover\" would make the link \nuseless for anyone else.  On the other hand, probably 50 xclocks quietly\nupdating every 10 seconds or so wouldn't impact it too much.  In the real\nworld, you will be somewhere in between these two extremes.\n\nGoing by the way I personally use X on a daily basis, I wouldn't want to have\nto share that 64k link with more than 3-4 other people.\n\n\nOur corporate WAN is as unique as any other.  The usage patterns are not very\ngood predictors of how yours will behave.  The only one of our low bandwidth\nlinks that normally get used in this way is a 56k link to Ireland that they\noften use to run a DOS text based client end of a client-server database \nremotely from the DVX machine behind me. Since the server end is (or was) always\nat this end (California) it is faster to remotely run the client via DESQview\nX and have a short hop to the server than running the client locally and having\na long hop to the server.  As I warned you, this tells us very little about\nhow you usage pattern will fill a 64k ISDN link.\n\nRunning Word for Windows remotely is going to itself be very usage dependent.\nLet's break it into pieces and look at it.  Tracking the mouse pointer is easy\nand efficient to translate from Windows calls into X. Popping up a menu is a\nlittle more involved and will generate some traffic.  Restoring the screen\nthat was covered by that menu may be easy and may not be.  Does the server\nthat it's displaying on have backing store?  If so and the server had enough\nmemory the display can be updated locally and will generate little network\ntraffic. If no backing store, then what was being covered up?  If it was a \nsolid colored rectangle of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quite\neasily.  If it was a full color backdrop of Ren & Stimpy we may have to send\nit back to the X server bit by bit.  DVX will do its level best to only redraw\nthat small area, but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be \nrepainted.  Assuning a 1024x768 screen with 4 bits per pixel that's 3145728 bits\nthat has to be sent.  Worst possible case you're looking at about 50 seconds.\nIn reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts \nthat will be tranlatable into higher level X calls.\n\n\nX was designed from the ground up to be efficient across a network.  It's \npretty good for this.  X programs are best, DOS text programs are almost\nas good (since we conert them to X easily).  Something like WinX is a hybrid.\nWe intercept the calls Windows makes to it's graphics driver/ mouse driver\nkeyboard driver and convert them to X.  The calls Windows is making are in\nno way designed to be efficient on a packet switched network.  We go to a \nlot of trouble to convert them to the highes level Xlib calls we can, but\nwe are somewhat limited because we only know what Windows and its applications\ntell us.", "label": 5}

EDT\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you \nin the thousands of communities around the country that are taking \npart in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.\n\t     \n\t     You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas \nJefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to \nmention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he \nhas been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all \nfollowed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education \nhere in this great country.  The success of our democracy according \nto Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational \nsystem.\n\t     \n\t     His philosophy of government, his belief in the \nimportance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest \nhere this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us \nPresident Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in \nthe Chamber of Commerce studios.  \n\t     \n\t     Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for \ntaking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite \nnetwork and we welcome you here this evening.\n\t     \n\t     Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.  \nAnd, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening \nalso.\n\t     \n\t     I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure \nmany of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that \nyou'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In \nWashington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.\n\t     \n\t     I believe the President has a few words that he might \nwant to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that \nat this time.  It's great to have you.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\n\t     \n\t     I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob \nReich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the \nChamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making, \nalong with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine \ntonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people \nfrom school to the work place.\n\t     \n\t     I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts, \nrecognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this \neconomy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to \nwork together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to \nmake things happen.\n\t     \n\t     This satellite town meeting is a good example of that \nkind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home \nstate pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart \nCorporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing \nseveral hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I \nappreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all \nthe rest of you.\n\t     \n\t     I have tried as hard as I could to move toward \nconstructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about \nthis being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson \nbelieved in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in \neducation; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion, \nfreedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and \nthird, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.  \n\t     \n\t     If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this \nbeautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful \ncherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change \nwith changing times.\n\t     \n\t     For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit \nand increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we \ncan compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight --\nabout what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless \nwe do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in \ngovernment, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase \nour investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the \nlong run.\n\t     \n\t     We also have to have people who can carry their load.  \nAnd in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven \nor eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system \nand continues into the work force where education must go on for a \nlifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can \nlearn.\n\t     \n\t     And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing \nwe're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership \nbetween the Labor Department and the Education Department and the \nprivate sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're \ntrying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that \nwould create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many \nthousands that have a strong education component so our young people \ncan be learning and working at the same time.\n\t     \n\t     Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good \nplace we can begin, I think, the discussion.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.\n\t     \n\t     Each month we get together and talk about ways that all \ncitizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And \ntonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours \ncan prepare students for this world of work.\n\t     \n\t     This week, the Education Department and the Labor \nDepartment are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called \nSummer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.  \nThe aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's \nproposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched \njobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged \nareas of the country.  \n\t     \n\t     Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it \nsomewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls \nfor more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your \nwords is that so important?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.  \nFirst of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may \nhave had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want \nthem to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to \ncontinue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of \nresearch that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may \nforget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year \nover the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for \nschools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already \ntaught before.\n\t     \n\t     Secondly, we want to help these young people progress, \nnot only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to \nabolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is \nlearning because we think that the best and most productive workers \nwill have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience \ncould maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to \nsucceed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are \ndisadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go \ninto the next year, is really even greater.  \n\t     \n\t     Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs \nthroughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this \neducational component of training.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr. \nSecretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer \nor for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with \neducation is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people, \nfor example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning \ngeometry.  But when they actually are there building something or \nworking on something, and they can see the exact and direct \napplication of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a \nlot of young people -- just that sense of connection between \neducation and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.  \nIt's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of \nyoung people even beyond the summer.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.  \n\t     \n\t     Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship \nprogram, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell \nus a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it \ndeveloping.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why \nit's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade \nwill not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will \nrequire some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people \nget in a high school diploma.  \n\t     \n\t     If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries \nof young people that had at least two years of good post-high school \neducation was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young \npeople who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not \ngo up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because \nthey weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their \nemployers.\n\t     \n\t     So we think America has a big economic interest in \ntrying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school \nbut don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes \ntwo years of further training either in a community college, a \nvocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in \nthis budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some \nfunds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states \nand with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in \na way that would be customized essentially by the business community, \nbased on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could \nrevolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and \nthe earnings of American workers.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think \nyou know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the \npeople watching this program -- that the business community and \neducators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many \nof our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In \nfact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The \npeople watching this program probably are the ones who are most \ndirectly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley \nand I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes \nalready out there.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight \nabout youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning  \ncareer academies.  And what features all those programs that deal \nwith this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of \nthese school-to-work programs might have that   are important?\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and \nyou and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much \nlonger than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business \ncommunity is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're \ndoing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The \nChamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these \nkinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've \naimed to work very closely with the Chamber.\n\t     \n\t     The business community is going to be actively engaged \nin developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and \nhelping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions \ndevelop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.\n\t     \n\t     Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is \none of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these \nplayers in a community come together and work together and cooperate \ntogether.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and \nthe business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody \nis talking, but they're not really working together in a common \nstrategy.\n\t     \n\t     And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick, \nwould be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic \nexcellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a \ntracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to \nmake it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be \neligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year \ncollege, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're \ntalking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation \nskills for on-the-job learning.\n\t     \n\t     And again, those are the critical components.  It's \nalready being done.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one \npoint based on my personal experience at home -- the business \ncommunity has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are \nthe job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught, \nbut also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort \nof partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are \ngoing to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the \nsecond-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and \ninfluence them.  So I think that's very important.\n\t     \n\t     And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at \nthe federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some \nfunds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make \nsure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the \nquality of these programs, because that's really what's going to \ndetermine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of \ncourse, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery \nprogram for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about \nlong-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr. \nPresident, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the \ncommunities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be \ncoming forth before too long.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I \nwere both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public \nschools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that \na lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.  \n\t     \n\t     I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals \nthat the governors drafted, along with representatives of President \nBush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to \ndo this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in \nCongress that will actually define the things that the national \ngovernment ought to do to try to help the local schools and the \nchildren of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those \ngoals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school \nready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school \ngraduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are \nconfident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are \nsecond to none in math and science; that are schools are safe, \ndisciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took \nthem out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of \nlife-long learning in this country.\n\t     \n\t     And each one of those goals there's a national role, a \nstate role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector \nrole.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to \nintroduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is; \nand then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job \nis and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality \nthat we need to meet.\n\t     \n\t     It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite \nlike it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.  \nNot mandating and telling people what they have to do with their \nmoney, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and \npartnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really \nit will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms \nof its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to \nsupport and facilitate and to help out in these education reform \nefforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.\n\t     \n\t     Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to \nthe telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of \ncourse, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and \nI wonder if you would comment on that.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of \nour young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they \ndon't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system \nof community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had \nnational skill standards to which they could aspire and which \nemployers would understand as a national credential, many of these \nyoung people would actually find that they were much more eligible \nfor jobs.\n\t     \n\t     Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other \ncountries you have smaller proportions of their population going to \ncollege, but you have a whole level of people who have certain \ntechnical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If \nyou don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to \ndevelop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working \nwith the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private \nindustry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the \nkinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other \ninstitutions to rally around, as well as our business community.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go \nahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce \nTodd of Austin, Texas.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and \nRiley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We \nhave some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who \nhave heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me \nsimply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with \nmuch of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are \nvery supportive.  \n\t     \n\t     We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our \nsummer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to \nhave over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much \nas 3,500 with the federal assistance.  \n\t     \n\t     Much of the question that we had designed you have \nanswered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But \nthe question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day \nwould be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round \nis even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal \nlevel might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-\nround basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the \nlocal community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's \nsomething that we believe is very important to success in this \neffort.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to \nanswer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling, \nand thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.  \nI've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.  \n\t     \n\t     First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can \nstructure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer \nprogram and that will move a lot of these young people back into \nschools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in \nthe private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to \ntry to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs \nto be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're \nworking on that.\n\t     \n\t     Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the \nCongress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to \nbuild in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job \ntraining programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give \nheavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you \nasked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we \nhope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being \ntrained on a year-round basis.\n\t     \n\t     And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said \na moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen \nas work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people \nactually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when \nthey're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we \nhope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and \nwe hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget \ncuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue \nraisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be \nable to do just what you seem to want based on your question.\n\t     \n\t     Bob, do you want to say anything?\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out \nof my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing, \nand that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high \nschool for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in \naddition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of \njobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.  \nIt's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the \neconomy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything \nelse.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I \nthink this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I \nthink is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or \ngreater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going \nto be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything \nright, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000 \nwill be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into \nnext year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it \nwill be -- action plans with every state where we can be working \ntogether to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And \nthen the state, with all the various school districts, a very \nimportant part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I \nthink everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that \nmoving.\n\t     \n\t     The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.  \n\t     \n\t     Doctor?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to \nbe on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school \nand work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since \nits inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two \nalternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages \nwe have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an \nextremely effective learning strategy.\n\t     \n\t     And over the years, we've come to believe that there are \nseveral principles that are very important in bridging the school and \nwork.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with \npractice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure \nto careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect \nupon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and \nlastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the \ndevelopment of high performance competencies.  \n\t     \n\t     My question, then is:  How can the general education \nfaculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with \ntransition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies \ncan you suggest to achieve this integration?\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think -- \nand we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting \nwork going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next \nguests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists   \nin that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to \nthem and we can discuss it later.\n\t     \n\t     You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one \nthing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as \nclear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the \npeople who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more \nexplicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics \nis very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish \nwhat I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is \nvocational learning and what is academic learning.\n\t     \n\t     I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think \nwe should have a strong component for people who are in the \nvocational program.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to \nrethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and \nwork combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're \nimportant for all students.  It's not just a special group of \nstudents that needs them.\n\t     \n\t     Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United \nStates -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream \nexperiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and \n12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience \nand then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on \nto college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they \ncan go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and \ncareer directions.\n\t     \n\t     But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often \ngoes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work-\nrelated work within the classroom, within our schools.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's \ngoing to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I \nthink you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank \nyou and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and \nyour ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  ", "label": 18}

He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex-\ngay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  \"There's no reality\nin it,\" he says, \"I was selling a product, and my product was a lie.\"\n  Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the\norganizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again\nChristianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who\nare just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their\nsexual urges and embracing Christianity.  \"We offer support to people who are\nseeking to leave the sin of homosexuality,\" explains Bob Davies, director of\nExodus.  He ventures that \"about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo-\nsexuality are men.\"\n  \"Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting\ntheir time,\" says Lisa Seeley, a former \"redeemed lesbian\" who worked with\nCaligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  \"These\norganizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded.\"\n  \"It's possible to change your identity or your behavior,\" says sex educator\nBrian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. \"But it's really impossible to\nchange your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay,\nbut they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings.\"\n  Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all\nhell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both\ntheir romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted\nby a man he picked up in a bar.  \"I was really drunk,\" he recalls, \"and I\nwent home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all\nnight, and the next morning he raped me again.\"\n  When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the\nhome he shared with his ex-lover.  \"He had another man there with him,\"\nCaligiuri recalls.  \"I thought at this time, 'If this is what being gay is\nabout, I don't want to be this way anymore.\"\n  Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery\nwith others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix's\ngay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its\nfirst public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance,\nFree Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed\nfor hell.\n  Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks\nin part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  \"We were listed\nunder Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services,\" Caligiuri says, \"so people\nthought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out\nwhere the local bars were, and we'd preach to them about the sins of homo-\nsexuality.\"  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says,\nadding, \"They'll do anything to reach these people.\"\n  \"David used to go on radio and say really stupid things,\" recalls Peter\nKelly, a counselor at Phoenix's Catholic diocese AIDS program, \"like that\nhe knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.\"\n  Caligiuri's family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on\nRaphael's syndicated talk show in 1985.  \"They were relieved,\" he recalls.\n\"They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better\nthat I should be a 'reformed' gay person.\"\n  But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  \"By the time I appeared on Sally's\nshow,\" \"I'd started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline\nand tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their\nfather.  I was horny all the time.\"\n  Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his\nnumerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he \"used to go to bookstores\nand get blowjobs.\"  When he wasn't working the bookstores, he was sleeping\nwith other \"reformed\" homosexuals.\n  \"I didn't realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex\nwith one another,\" Caligiuri says.  \"We'd go to conferences in other cities,\nand we'd be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody\nelse.\"\n  By the time he appeared on 'AM Philadelphia' television show in May 1988,\nCaligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show's\nhost asked him if he ever \"acted on temptation,\" his answer was a lie.\n  Caligiuri's duplicity began to take it's toll on him, however.  He was\nsuffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating\nyeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  \"I was too sick\nto go to church,\" he explains.  \"The more time I spent away from those people\nthe more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be.\"\n  Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local\nchurch and closed the ministry's doors.  \"I'd convinced myself that there\nis no need in the world for ex-gay people,\" he says.\n  Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (\"I'm interest-\ned in belief systems that aren't judgemental.\"), considering romance (\"But\nnot with a CHristian!\"), and searching for a new project to devote himself to.\n\"I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes,\" he says.  \"I want to\neventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I\nmay have brought to our community.\"\n\n---end article---\n\nCaligiuri's tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles\nof former leaders and founders of 'ex-gay' ministries who have said very similar th\nsimilar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have\ncome to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some,\nlike Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian \"Lazarus Project\" of West\nHollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community\nto bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values\nof sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become\nand become close friends with many who once attended such groups as \"Love In\nAction\" and others, who either once claimed to have been \"reformed\" or who\nwere too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed\nin them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of \"sealing\" their\nnew heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses\nand bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of\nnight and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous \"sin\"\nthrough a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch\nhas dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno-\ncent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet\nthe church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow\ngay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also\nmrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and\nfear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on\nthem, they may even opt for 'suicide' or surgical dampering of the brain\nfunctions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common-\nplace.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the\nthreat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington's\n_\"Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact\nbased books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as\nMaury Johnston's _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser's _Come Hom!_.  I\nseriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and\nself-acceptance.", "label": 19}

{"text": ": \n: Of course, penalties will have to be changed:\n: \n: Roughing:\tChauvanistic Males Being Aggressive\n: Slashing:\tChauvanistic Males Venting Frustration\n: Fighting:\tProof That Males Cannot Cope With Their Feelings\n: \n\nNO NO NO! since all the penalties fall into three classes, there should\nonly be three penalties:\n\n1. Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your\n   body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.\n\n2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the\n   current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you\n   are thrown out of the game, and fined.\n\n3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot\n   is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.\n\nBesides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties\nin a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one,\nuntil the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was in\nthe act of shooting when the foul ocured.\n\nThis works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the most\nexciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better.\nNext, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can\ntake a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the network\nannouncers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, and\nMarv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before\nthe PA announcer says it.\n\nOh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play\ncannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the network\ncan sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has told\nthem who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a \nchance of pronouncing his name right.\n\nSeriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week,\nfor the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play is\nso slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting\ncontests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the 'Laker Girls' get to do their \nroutines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periods\neither. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. The\ngame is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a\n10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.\n\nThe reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw in\ncommercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening.\nOn TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watch\nit on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, then\nit truly is a sad day.\n\nEnough for now.", "label": 10}

Put the following on a gopher server:\n\n       Type=1\n       Host=boombox.micro.umn.edu\n       Port=70\n       Path=\n       Name=Gopher Software Distribution.\n\n \n     Or point your gopher client at boombox.micro.umn.edu, port 70 and\n     look in the gopher directory.\n\n\n     There are also a number of public telnet login sites available.\n     The University of Minnesota operates one on the machine\n     \"consultant.micro.umn.edu\" (134.84.132.4) See Q3 for more\n     information about this.  It is recommended that you run the client\n     software instead of logging into the public telnet login sites.  A\n     client uses the custom features of the local machine (mouse,\n     scroll bars, etc.)  A local client is also faster.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ3:  Where are there publicly available logins (ie places to telnet to\n     in order to get a taste of gopher) for Gopher?\n\nA3:  Here is a short list, use the site closest to you to minimize\n     network lag.\n\n     Telnet Public Logins:\n\n     Hostname                  IP#              Login   Area\n     ------------------------- ---------------  ------  -------------\n     consultant.micro.umn.edu  134.84.132.4\tgopher  North America\n     gopher.uiuc.edu           128.174.33.160   gopher  North America\n     panda.uiowa.edu           128.255.40.201\tpanda   North America\n     gopher.sunet.se           192.36.125.2     gopher  Europe\n     info.anu.edu.au           150.203.84.20    info    Australia\n     gopher.chalmers.se        129.16.221.40    gopher  Sweden\n     tolten.puc.cl             146.155.1.16     gopher  South America\n     ecnet.ec\t\t           157.100.45.2     gopher  Ecuador\n     gan.ncc.go.jp             160.190.10.1     gopher  Japan\n\n\n     It is recommended that you run the client software instead of\n     logging into the public login sites.  A client uses the\n     custom features of the local machine (mouse, scroll bars, etc.)\n     and gives faster response.  Furthermore many of the basic features\n     of clients - saving a file to your hard drive, printing a file\n     to a local printer, viewing images, retrieving files from ftp\n     sites etc.... are not available by the telnet logins.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ4:  Who Develops Gopher Software?\n\nA4:  Gopher was originally developed in April 1991 by the University\n     of Minnesota Microcomputer, Workstation, Networks Center to help\n     our campus find answers to their computer questions.  \n\n     It has since grown into a full-fledged World Wide Information\n     System used by a large number of sites in the world.\n\n     Many people have contributed to the project, too numerous to\n     count. \n\n     The people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached\n     via e-mail at gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu, or via paper mail:\n   \n      Internet Gopher Developers\n      100 Union St. SE #190\n      Minneapolis, MN 55455  USA\n\n     Or via FAX at:\n \n      +1 (612) 625-6817\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)?\n\nA5: Gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems.\n     As shipped the Unix gopher server has the capability to: \n     \n       - Search local WAIS indices.\n       - Query remote WAIS servers and funnel the results to gopher\n         clients.\n       - Query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher\n         clients.\n       - Be queried by WWW (World Wide Web) clients (either using\n         built in gopher querying or using native http querying.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available?\n\nA6: Gopher has a whole chapter devoted to it in :\n\n     _The_Whole_Internet_, Ed Kroll, O'Reilly, 1992 (Editors note:\n                             ..Great book, go out and buy a bunch!)\n\n     _The_Internet_Passport: NorthWestNet's Guide to Our World Online\"\n     By Jonathan Kochmer and NorthWestNet.

As archie is to ftp archives, veronica \n     is to gopherspace.  A veronica search produces a menu of gopher\n     items, each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source.\n     Because veronica is accessed through a gopher client, it is easy\n     to use, and gives access to all types of data supported by the\n     gopher protocol.\n\n     To try veronica, select it from the \"Other Gophers\" menu on \n     Minnesota's gopher server, or point your gopher at:\n\n     Name=veronica (search menu items in most of GopherSpace) \n     Type=1 \n     Port=70 \n     Path=1/veronica \n     Host=futique.scs.unr.edu\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQ8: What is Available for Biology?\n\nA8: There is an incredible amount of software, data and information\n    availble to biologists now by gopher.\n\nHere is a brief list of the Biological Databases that you can search \nvia gopher:\n\n      2.

{"text": "\n\nThe problem you see here is that some Christians claim things about\nthe Bible which they don't actually believe or practice. I've known\nall sorts of Christians, ranging from the trendiest of liberals to\nthe fire-breathing fundamentalists, and although many on the \nconservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible is\na (perhaps *the*) source of absolute truth, I don't know of anyone\nwho treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition.\nWhile I am not a Roman Catholic, I believe this is close to the official\nposition of the RC church (perhaps an RC would like to comment).\n\nThe particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in\nterms of the social context of the time. You would think the fact \nthat the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat-and-cane \nand give you some big song-and-dance routine about why this \n(other passages as well) aren't directly applicable today would \nshow them that what they claim about the Bible and what they \nactually practice are two different things, but mostly it doens't.\n\nWhile this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians,\nI would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy, in this\ncase, making claims about the Bible which the claimants don't actually\nput into practice. But if we step back from the name-calling and\nlook at what people are attempting to say, we see that they are trying\nto express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the\nChristian faith. So when people use such words or phrases as \"Word of\nGod\", \"inerrant\", \"infallibale\", \"The Manufacturer's Handbook\", \"The\nonly rule of faith and practice in the church today\" to describe the\nBible, we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at\nthe mere words they use. Some of the above descriptions are demostratably\nfalse and others are self-contradictory, but in my experience people are\ngenerally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even\nwhen the speaker's words are at variance with their intentions. A Biblical\nexample is from the garden of Eden where God asks \"Where are you?\" and Adam\nexplains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself. If Adam had\nanswered God's words he would have said something like \"I'm here in this\ntree.\" The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that these\nwords are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif. Most people\nhave not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of\nthe place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases\nand explanations that others use.\n\nI hope this helps.\n--\n                                                                     ___\nBill Rea                                                            (o o)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---", "label": 15}

{"text": "\n\nThe company was probably \"Public Missiles, Inc\" of Michigan.\n\n\nYup.\n\n\nNope, it's not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to \npurchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be\none of the following:\na) An employee of a government agency.\nb) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets.\nc) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in\nresearch or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations: \nThe Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry.\nMembers of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction\nand flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.\n\nThe FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any \norganization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions \nto avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are:\n- Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the\nlocation, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL. \n- The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft\nwithin the operating radius around the launch site.\n- Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited.\n- The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that\nunmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.\n\nMost of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)\nare held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the\nwestern deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular\nsince it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).\n\nThe two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members'\nuse, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is\nfrom 50 to 500 or more feet. \n\nBy the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an \"F\" motor are exempt from\nmost Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart\nC, for details.\n\nAs for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to\n50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical\nrocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute,\nor multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry\neither a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches\nin the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.\n\nCamera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.\n\n\nWhy not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets\nfor information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything\nbigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to\npractice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs\ntakeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.\n\n\nThat's another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESE\nROCKETS. NONE! Please forgive me for shouting, but that's one of the biggest\nmisconceptions people have about our hobby. \n\nTrue. But it will not be related to the rocket hobby, unless I get \nhit while crossing a road with a rocket in my hand. ", "label": 14}

{"text": "Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable.  However it is also \nwidely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity. \nAnd in ordinary life, perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is \nindicative of a psychological disorder.  In the extreme case, a  \nperfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might \nmake that he is unable to even leave the house.  \n\nIn science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible \nand we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these \ndiscoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata \n--- the search for scope and the search for certainty.  \n\nIf 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and \nLeibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neither \nof the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, since \nthey lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact, because of the lack of \na rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus. \nIt was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid \ngrounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless, what Newton \nand Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great \ndeal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost \nthrough the mistakes they made.  \n\n\nThese are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and\nsci.psychology.  According to these posters  \"If it's not supported by\ncarefully designed controlled studies then it's not science.\"\n\nTaken to the extreme, I believe that the attitude that empirical studies \nare everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification \nof science.  \n\nFor one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology \nresults in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outside \nthe establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have \nno chance to obtain a hearing.  (I don't in the least believe that this \nis the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology.  Nonetheless, \nit is one of the results.)   And although institutional science has \ncertainly produced many wonderful results, I think it is a foolish \narrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment \n--- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever come \nwith anything worthwhile.  \n\nFurthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is\none of the most significant errors in science:  choosing to investigate\nquestions because they can be readily handled by the currently\nfashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutional\nor corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention to\nthose questions which seem to have fundamental significance.\n\nFor instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated with\nstatistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative.\n(One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many\nareas of psychology.  In my opinion, a perusal of many of the papers\nresulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions\ninto a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin's\nassertion that current scientific methods \"avoid all known errors.\")\n\nI think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental \nerror in science.  (Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the \nothers.)  And I think that scientific journals are full of all \ntoo many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are \nworthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.

{"text": "\n\n\n# I hope I gave you a fairly solid answer to this one: I simply don't agree\n# with the embodied version of a Satan who is a separate creation or a force.\n\n\n\n# And there are quite physical descriptions of Heaven and Hell in the\n# Holy Qur'an, the Bible, etc.  There have been times in the spiritual\n# and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical\n# descriptions of Heaven, Hell, and Satan were taken quite literally\n# and that *worked* for the time.  As I mentioned in the Tradition\n# cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory\n# about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the \"evil\"\n# which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as \"satanic.\"\n\n     Which begs the question: if Satan in this case is\n     metaphorical, how can you be certain Allah is not\n     the same way?\n\n# The bottom line here, however, is that describing a spiritual plane\n# in human language is something like describing \"color\" to a person\n# who has been blind from birth.  You may want to read the book\n# FLATLAND (if you haven't already) or THE DRAGON'S EGG.  The first\n# is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con-\n# cept...\n\n[some deleted for space saving]\n\n# When language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe\n# another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers, then\n# such conventions as metaphor, allegory, and the like come to be\n# necessary.  The \"unseen\" is described in terms which have reference`\n# and meaning for the reader/listener.  But, like all models, a compro-\n# mise must be made when speaking metaphorically: clarity and directness\n# of meaning, equivalence of perception, and the like are all\n# crippled.  But what else can you do?\n\n     This is why I asked the above.  How would you then\n     know God exists as a spirit or being rather than\n     just being metaphorical?  I mean, it's okay to say\n     \"well, Satan is just metaphorical,\" but then you\n     have to justify this belief AND justify that God is\n     not some metaphor for something else.\n\n     I say this because there are many, many instances of\n     Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in \n     the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the\n     New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is\n     described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know\n     one is metaphorical and not the other.\n\n     Further, belief in God isn't a bar to evil.  Let's\n     consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were\n     metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe\n     in God to justify this belief.  Again, we have a \n     case where someone does believe in God, but by\n     religious standards, they are \"evil.\"  If Bobby\n     does see this, let him address this question also.\n\n[deleted some more on \"metaphor\"]\n\n\nStephen\n\n    _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/       _/    * Atheist\n   _/        _/    _/   _/ _/ _/ _/     * Libertarian\n  _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/   _/  _/      * Pro-individuality\n       _/  _/     _/  _/       _/       * Pro-responsibility\n_/_/_/_/  _/      _/ _/       _/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...\n\n", "label": 0}

A sample ftp session \nis given at the end of this file.\n\n**********************************************************************\n\n--> Changes in Version 0.9 (update from v0.81 to v0.9)\n\n\tIn this version, we have revised COSY_PAK to take advantage of \nthe more robust signal processing functions available in Mathematica v2.1.  \nSince Mathematica 2.1 provides a better  and  working \nLaplaceTransform and InverseLaplaceTransform functions than \nMathematica v2.0 did, we adopted them. This has made COSY_PAK \nsmaller. Thus Brian Evans' Signal Processing packages that supported \nthe LaplaceTransform  and InverseLaplaceTransform functions in the \nCOSY_PAK v0.81 are no longer needed directly by COSY_PAK v0.9. For \npower users who  use Signal Processing we still recommend the use of the very  \nfine  Brian Evans package on Signal Processing (available at \nthe anonymous  ftp site gauss.eedsp.gatech.edu  or  IP # 130.207.226.24).  On  \nthe  downside, the disadvantage of this update \ncan be that Mathematica 2.1 requires more runtime resources than its \nprevious version. \n\n\n***********************************************************************\t\n--> For Mathematica 2.0 users\n\t\n\tWe have included the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica 2.1 in  \nthe directory `For_2.0'. Please move all files and directory under For_2.0 into  \nthe Calculus directory under Mathematica Packages directory. \n\n**************************************************************************\n\t    \n--> Introduction\n   \n    This is an unsupported release of COSY_PAK - a COntrol SYstems \nanalysis PAcKage for symbolic control systems analysis using \nMathematica 2.1. Classical control systems analysis and design methods and some  \nmodern control systems methods have been implemented in this package. \n    \n    This package and the attendant notebooks were developed on a \nNeXT (TM) computer (a UNIX based workstation). They have been \nused as a supplementary teaching aid along with  standard control \nengineering texts (Ogata [1991], Phillips and Harbor [1991]) for \nundergraduate courses in `Control Engineering I' taught at the Systems \nEngineering Department of CWRU. In addition to the NeXT, they have \nalso been tested successfully on Apple Macintosh computers (TM), and, \nIBM PC's (TM) running MS Windows(TM). We would be very much interested \nto hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this software on \nplatforms not mentioned above. IBM users however will have to \nevaluate the notebooks first to visualize the graphics.\n\n    Once installed (see below for instructions), this  collection  of  \nMathematica  packages  can be loaded by any user. Bundled with the \npackages are many notebooks (\"COSY_Notes\") which demonstrate  \nthe functionality of these packages.

In addition, people often request information which has\nbeen posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the\nalt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following\ntitles:\n\n   1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers\n   2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism\n   3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n   4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument\n   5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources\n\nThis is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  The\nothers are entirely optional.\n\nIf you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup\nnews.announce.newusers.  The articles titled \"A Primer on How to Work With\nthe Usenet Community\", \"Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet\"\nand \"Hints on writing style for Usenet\" are particularly relevant.  Questions\nconcerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.\n\nIf you are unable to find any of the articles listed above, see the \"Finding\nStuff\" section below.\n\n\n                                   Credits\n\nThese files could not have been written without the assistance of the many\nreaders of alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated.

Truly free.  You may copy them and distribute them\nto anyone you wish.  However, please send any changes or corrections to the\nauthor, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it\ndoes nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating\naround the network.\n\n\n                                Finding Stuff\n\nAll of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are\nsome suggestions on what to do if you can't find them:\n\n1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with\n   \"Alt.Atheism FAQ:\".\n\n2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.\n\n   If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up\n   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the\n   problem.\n\n3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].\n   Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest\n   versions of the FAQ files there.\n\n   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you\n   need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to\n   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n\n      send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq\n\n   in the body.\n\n4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article\n   \"Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup\" carries a list of these\n   sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.\n\n5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu\n   consisting of the following lines:\n\n      send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/faq\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/logic\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/resources\n\n5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of\n   the following lines:\n\n      send atheism/faq/faq.txt\n      send atheism/faq/logic.txt\n      send atheism/faq/intro.txt\n      send atheism/faq/resource.txt\n\n   and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.\n   There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are \"help\" and\n   \"send atheism/index\".\n\n6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the\n   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this\n   if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to\n   clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.\n   it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,\n   people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have \n   FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.\n", "label": 0}

{"text": "\n\tRemember me, Tom?  I hope you'll respond, and I seem to\nbe a Voice of Reason or some such (I've been recieving fan mail,\nso naturally my ego is somehwat inflated of late), and hope to\nmake a few points here.\n\n\n\tAnd our argument is that you cannot remove them from the people\nwho need restricting and not remove them from the people who don't.  A\nfairly simple problem, given our size and numbers.  Do you agree?  We\nall believe criminals, particularly violent criminals, should not have\nfirearms.  The problem is making a law that does this without trodding\nupon the rights of the vast majority.  Nobody here seems to be able to\ndo it, and I doubt anybody in Norway can either.  Thus, we are left with\na philosophical difference: does the safety of a few justify restricting\nthe many?  We say \"no,\" while others say \"yes.\"\n\n\n\tCan you provide a method that cannot be abused?  I doubt it.\n\n\n\tOf course.  This is not in contention.  What is in contention\nis how much one has to pay.\n\n\n\tIt is this \"giving a little\" that makes Americans wary...\nWe have seen this argument before.  You might remember how a\nChamberlain \"gave a little\" to a particular fascist/short asshole,\nand how such \"appeasement\" worked.  While it might work in some\ninstances, it doesn't work in others, and since we cannot predict\nthe future we must be cautious in using actions that have a\nhistory of failure.\n\n\n\tCars are not essential in Norway any more than they are in\nthe USA.  I'm willing to bet that you have neighbors that would be\nwilling to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a price.  Thus,\ncars are not essential for your transportation.  However, the\narguments presented show that, since cars are used to kill far more\npeople than guns in the USA, it makes much more sense to restrict\ncars than it does guns.  How one defines \"essential\" often depends\nupon what one is willing to go through for that service.  When we\nlook at the raw data, such comparisons are not individually weighed.\n\n\n\tThis depends upon what the populace was willing to do.  As\nDesert Storm proved, even an armed populace won't just revolt even\nwhen given a chance.  Still, would Hitler have done all that he did\nwith an armed populace?  We have to wonder, as some of his first\nacts were to confiscate firearms.  Other points in history show\nthat dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the populace.\nThus, we're left wondering if Hitler would have been overthrown\nor if King George was just unlucky in keeping the USA as a colony.\nOne can argue both sides; one also has to live with each action.\n\n\n\tIt is about #2, but so far all proposals to curtail #2 have\nwound up enforcing #1 as well.
