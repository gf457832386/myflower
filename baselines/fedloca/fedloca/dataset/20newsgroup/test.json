Horror stories about the\ncontents of those groups (e.g. exploitative pictures of possibly underaged\nmodels) have already surfaced in the press.

An\nEFF lobbying effort for cryptography would be too easily derailed by the\nconnection to child pornography and the like.\n\nSimilarly, LPF is connected with Stallman and his Gnu project.

For\nproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\n\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\nfrom past masters.\n\n     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\n\"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.\" \nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you've made us mad!  What are these\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\n\n     Well I'll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\n\"fact\" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\nless than many billions of dollars.\n\n     It took some of the last generation's experts to teach us\nsome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun's first rocket was not a\nSaturn V.  General Schriever's ICBM's didn't take ten years to\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn't cost $1 billion.\n\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950's to remind\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960's. \nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\nlittle, Test a little.\n\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\ndidn't solicit a bunch of requirements -- they'd just change\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\nALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\nknown as \"Shape Shifter\" than \"Space Lifter.\"  We didn't spend a\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When's the\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn't\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\nthreat that he'd get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\nit ran over cost or schedule.\n\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn't keep in mind its\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\nbudget.\n\n     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:\n(See charts)\n\n     I'm embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950's\nand 1960's.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\ncan't see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\n\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\n\n     I say to you -- we'll see you at White Sands in June.  You\nbring your view-graphs, and I'll bring my rocketship.  If we do\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.

Does\nthis mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder\nbecause he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent\nsupporter?\n\nOne of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the system\nwas far more evil than any single member. Once created the NAZI party\nitself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide, there was\nnoone within it strong enough to prevent it. Remember that Hitler did not\noriginaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within it\nuntil his oratory allowed the party to come to power. Had Hitler reneged\nupon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of \nhis supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the\nold guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications\nof their rhetoric. \n\nThis is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies must\nbe considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs. The idea that one \"race\"\nof people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of\nhumanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome,\nthe gas chambers of Auschwitz.\n\nThe NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who\nlead an entire country astray, beyond the evil of individuals there was the\nevil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating.\nHitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego\ncult centered on the demonstration of his own power, this does not however\nmean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and\nhis propagandists worked so hard to assert. The myth that racism can\nproduce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be \nemphatically rejected. In the same way we must accept a distinction between\na govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to \ngovern decisively in the manner it beleives is best. I would accept only the\nlatter as a \"strong\" government since most displays of strength are made\nnecessary by an essential weakness.\n\nIt is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were they\namoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples. They acted in the\nsame manner as the Spanish Inquisition - murder and torture in the cause\nof morality. The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms, not in their\nlogic nor in their implementation of those axioms. Thus all such parties\nsuch as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assert\nthe truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are, advocates\nof a system that would commit genocide. \n\nThe conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is\ninescapable from the historical record. It is important though to not let\nthe conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas that\nwere basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent. The evils of\nthe concept of race supremacy are primary. Although this most emphaticaly\ndoes not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary.\n\nNo matter what the promises made by a racist, supremacist party upon \nelection those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit.\nIf this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made\nthe pledges, that will occur. Hatred is a supreme justifier. It also creates\na dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign. For many\nin government politics is a method of providing a justification for\ntheir own existence through a demonstration of their importance. A \nrhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the\ncontinued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the\nessential impotence of the politician. Thus we have the US raid on Tripoli\nwhich has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power. It is important\nto realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right\nand those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement\nof popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice.\nIn the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through\ntheir assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology.\n\nIt is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics\nof political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants. The\nleaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do\nso voluntarily are required to stive to do so. Thus to take on such a \ntask without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of\nones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime. Furthermore\nin taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the whole\nbefore personal concerns, even of personal security.\n\nAlthough it was inevitable that a party such as the NAZIs, based upon hatred\nand an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commit\ngenocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded. Each member of\nthe system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibility\nof changing the dynamic. Realising that the individual cannot hope to \ncontrol a system does not mean accepting that the individual cannot \naffect the system.\n", "label": 18}

It is designed to be a simple and intuitive programming\ninterface to access the functionality of commonly used widgets.\nXm++ was initially created for the Motif widget set, now support for the\nAthena widgets was added. Applications created with Xm++ run in both\nenvironments without changes, although many nice features are only\navailable when using Motif.\nIn some situations Xm++ extends the underlying toolkit (i.e. providing\na ComboBox borrowed from MS-Windows), but never tries to replace it -\ndata of user interface objects is left to the widgets and only duplicated\nin rare cases.\n\nXm++ has nothing common with Motif++ besides the general idea to\nencapsulate Motif widgets in C++ objects and the '++' in it's name. Many\nideas for the Xm++ architecture came from Digitalk's Smalltalk version,\nwhich provides an easy to use framework for Windows/PM/Mac applications\n(in the very first time of development I used the Windows dialog editor and\na simple parser to create similar Smalltalk and Xm++ dialogs :-).\n\nTop level objects in Xm++:\n* 'Windows', 'SystemDialogs' and 'ToolBoxes' which use the automatic layout\n  feature of various composite widgets in Motif and Xaw\n* 'UserDialogs' which can be individually laid out with a user interface\n  builder (a first version of such a dialog editor is included in this\n  distribution)\n\nControls (children of top level objects):\n'staticText', 'staticImage', 'pushButton', 'checkBox', 'radioButton',\n'edit', 'listBox', 'comboBox', 'groupBox', 'paneArea', 'drawing', 'toolBar'\n\nThe staticImage and all the button classes can display b/w (X-bitmap\nformat) or color (GIF format) pictures as an alternative to a label text.\n\nEvent handling is done by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirects\nXt callbacks to member functions of Xm++ objects.\n\n\nCommonInteract(II) is built upon the Xm++ drawing class and provides\ncomponents for building direct manipulative applications. Is is a very\nsimplified implementation of some features from the CommonInteract system\n(research project of our institute in 1991), an approach to define a\nsoftware achitecture for implementing direct manipulative applications\nwith multiple interaction media (i.e. sound, alternative input devices).\nIf you are interrested, look into the June 1993 issue of the JOOP (SIGS\nPublications - Journal of Object Oriented Programming) - there should be\nour paper about CommonInteract (but be aware, that it is our 'state of\nthe art' from 1991).\nCommonInteract(II) is still undocumented and is included because it was\nused to implement the dialog editor. It currently supports only drawing\nprimitives (lines, rectangles, circles...), but we plan to extend it to\nsupport bitmaps and some controls also.\nKnown problem: the Xm++ drawing class has no redrawing strategy (always\nredraws the whole window, even after minimal changes like selecting an\nobject), this looks very ugly on slow displays and should be fixed.\n\n\nAbout this first release:\n\nXm++ is still incomplete and has a lot of bugs but we are using it here\nfor smaller applications which are running without problems. So I think\nI can call it a 'beta release' which can be used to develop applications\nfor any non-critical purposes.\nCommonInteract may be called a 'pre alpha release'. It's development will\nbe continued this year because we plan to use it for another research\nproject here. Besides incompleteness and the redrawing problem it seems\nto be stable and can be used for experimental applications.\n\nPlatforms: this release was compiled and tested on:\n  HP9000/720 running HP-UX 8.07\n  SUN SPARC running SunOS Release 4.1.1\n  PC-AT386 running Linux v0.99pl6\n\nCaution: although the whole stuff was initially developed using an AT&T\nstandard C++ compiler - this release is tested only with GNU g++ 2.3.3 or\nabove (the next release will be tested with both compilers).\n\nWhere to get it:\n================\n\nI have uploaded it on: export.lcs.mit.edu as: /contrib/Xm++.0.5.tar.Z\n\n(send a mail, if you cannot find it there, e-mail addr. below)\n\nWhere to find more information:\n===============================\n\nthe .../doc directory contains\n   INSTALL - how to build the libraries and examples\n   README.GNU - problems and limitations when using gnu g++ (read!!)\n   usersGuide.txt - a tutorial how to use Xm++\n   reference.txt - a first try of a Xm++ class reference manual\n\nthe README files in the .../samples gives a brief description of\neach of the seven samples.\n\n\nXm++/CommonInteract is free software for any non-profit purposes,\nsee the file .../lib/COPYRIGHT for details.\n\nSend any comments, bug reports and donations :-) to the Author:\n\n    Bernhard Strassl\n    Vienna User Interface Group\n\tInstitute for Applied Computer Science and Information Systems\n    University of Vienna\n    Lenaugasse 2/8, A-1080 Wien, Austria", "label": 5}

Any questions?\"\n\n\nPardon me, but possession/use of these drugs is still a crime!\nYou cannot analogize the rates at which drug users would seek\ntreatment, and the comparative ease with which it could be\nmade available today, when these drugs are illegal to possess/use,\nwith what it would be were they_not_illegal to possess/use.\nDecriminalizing possession and use makes treatment_much_easier.\nDrug dealers are exploiting the weaknesses of those persons who\nare prone to addiction, and as such, the drug users should be\nleft alone, not thrown in prison along with their victimizers.\nDrug_dealers_are the criminals, and should be treated as such.\nDrug addiction does not absolve you of responsiblity for your\ncriminal actions, however.\n\n\nThe drug test of an arrested suspect is voluntary, not coerced,\nand does not therefore constitute violation of Amendment V.\nThose convicted who are drug users, as evidenced by the test,\nare in need of treatment for their problem.  Institutionalization\nof these adddicted criminals is, I would argue, the best way to\nhelp them straighten out.  If they refuse the test and are convicted,\ntheir sentence can be appropriately harsher, since they, unlike the\naddict, have no \"excuse\" for their crimes.\n\n\nWhy not?  My objective is to discourage drug use_and_criminal\nbehavior.  If fewer criminals do drugs out of fear of getting a\nharsher sentence if they are convicted, why is that not a good\nthing?  If fewer drug dealers (who are still criminals, BTW)\ncan find victims, why is that not a good thing?  If fewer drug\nusers, such as drunks, 'potheads,' etc., commit crimes out of\nfear of being cut off from their sources of supply, why is that\nnot a good thing?\n\nI'm certainly willing to debate my position.\nYou have to read it carefully though.", "label": 18}

Helsingius?\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nIDENTITY\n========\n\n_____\n<1.1> What is `identity' on the internet?\n\n  Generally, today people's `identity' on the internet is primarily\n  determined by their email address in the sense that this is their\n  most unchanging 'face' in the electronic realm.   This is your\n  login name qualified by the complete address domain information,\n  for example ``ld231782@longs.lance.colostate.edu''.  People see\n  this address when receiving mail or reading USENET posts from you\n  and in other situations where programs record usage.  Some obsolete\n  forms of addresses (such as BITNET) still persist.\n\n  In email messages, additional information on the path that a message\n  takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient.  This\n  information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the\n  transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination.  This\n  type of identify-and-forward protocol is also used in the USENET\n  protocol to a lesser extent.  Forging these fields requires\n  corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and\n  is very uncommon.  Not so uncommon is forging the chain at the\n  origination point, so that all initial sites in the list are faked\n  at the time the message is created.  Tracing these messages can be\n  difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of\n  real machines and represent real transfer routes.\n\n_____\n<1.2> Why is identity (un)important on the internet?\n\n  The concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication,\n  privacy, and security, which in turn are all critical aspects of\n  computer networks. For example, the convenience of communication\n  afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for\n  identification.  But there are many potential abuses of identity\n  possible that can have very severe consequences, with massive\n  computer networks at the forefront of the issue, which can\n  potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems.\n\n  Verifying that an identity is correct is called `authentication',\n  and one classic example of the problems associated with it is\n  H.G.Well's ``War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast that fooled\n  segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was\n  in progress.  Hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on Usenet and\n  forged identities makes them more insidious.  People and their\n  reputations can be assaulted by forgery.\n\n  However, the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of\n  its most attractive features. Identity is just as useful as it is\n  harmful.  A professor might carefully explain a topic until he\n  finds he is talking to an undergraduate. A person of a particular\n  occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally\n  shun him.  Some prejudices are erased, but, on the other hand, many\n  prejudices are useful!  A scientist might argue he can better\n  evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more\n  about the authors.  Likewise, he may be more likely to reject it\n  based on unfair or irrelevant criteria.  On the other side of the\n  connection,  the author may find identities of reviewers useful in\n  exerting pressure for acceptance.\n\n  Identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating\n  `credit' (not necessarily financial) and `ownership' and `usage'. \n  Many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques\n  for identification. Heavy reliance will be placed on digital\n  authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic. \n  Many government functions and services are based on identification,\n  and law enforcement frequently hinges on it.  Hence, employees of\n  many government organizations push toward stronger identification\n  structures.  But when does identification invade privacy?\n\n  The growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive\n  proportions. Decisions made now on issues of identity will affect\n  many future users, especially as the network becomes increasingly\n  global, universal, widespread, and entrenched; and the positive or\n  adverse affects of these actions, intended and inadvertent,  will\n  literally be magnified exponentially.\n\n_____\n<1.3> How does my email address (not) identify me and my background?\n\n  Your email address may contain information that influences people's\n  perceptions of your background.  The address may `identify' you as\n  from a department at a particular university, an employee at a\n  company, or a government worker.  It may contain your last name,\n  initials, or cryptic identification codes independent of both.  In\n  the US some are based on parts of social security numbers.  Others\n  are in the form 'u2338' where the number is incremented in the\n  order that new users are added to the system.\n\n  Standard internet addresses  also can contain information  on your\n  broad geographical location or nationhood.  However, none of this\n  information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all.  The\n  fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on\n  rather arbitrary organization, such as (mostly invisible) network\n  cabling distributions.  The only point to make is that early fields\n  in the address are more specific (such as specific computer names\n  or local networks) and the later ones the most general (such as\n  continental domains).  Typically the first field is the name of the\n  computer receiving mail.\n\n  Gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an\n  inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise.  (For more\n  information, see the FAQs on email  addresses and known\n  geographical distributions below.)  However, UNIX utilities exist\n  to aid in the quest (see the question on this).\n\n  Common Suffixes\n  ---------------\n\n  .us    United States\n  .uk    United Kingdom\n  .ca    Canada\n  .fi    Finland\n  .au    Australia\n\n  .edu   university or college\n  .com   commercial organization\n  .org   'other' (e.g. nonprofit organization)\n  .gov   government\n  .mil   military site\n \n_____\n<1.4> How can I find out more about somebody with a given email address?\n\n  One simple way is to send email to that address, asking.  Another\n  way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address (i.e.\n  postmaster@address), although the postmaster's job is more to help\n  find user ID's of particular people given their real name and solve\n  mail routing problems.  The sysadmin (i.e. `root@address') may also\n  be able to supply information.  Users with related email address\n  may have information.  However, all of these methods rely on the\n  time and patience of others so use them minimally.\n\n  One of the most basic tools for determining identity over the\n  internet is the UNIX utility 'finger'.  The basic syntax is:\n\n    finger user@here.there.everywhere\n\n  This utility uses communication protocols to query the computer\n  named in the address for information on the user named.  The\n  response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may\n  be in any format.  Possible responses are as follows:\n\n  - A message `unknown host' meaning some aspect of the address is\n    incorrect, two lines with no information and '???'.\n  \n  - A message 'In real life: ???' in which case the receiving computer\n    could not find any kind of a match on the username. The finger\n    utility may return this response in other situations.\n  \n  - A listing of information associated with multiple users. Some\n    computers will search only for matching user IDs, others will\n    attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all\n    actual full names of users kept in a local database.\n  \n  At some sites 'finger' can be used to get a list of all users on the\n  system with a `finger @address'.  In general this is often\n  considered weak security, however, because `attackers' know valid\n  user ID's to `crack' passwords.\n\n  More information on the fields returned by `finger' is given below. \n  More information on `finger' and locating people's email addresses\n  is given in the email FAQ (such as the WHOIS lookup utility).  Just\n  as you can use these means to find out about others, they can use\n  them to find out about you.  You can `finger' yourself to find out\n  what is publicly reported by your UNIX system about you.  Be\n  careful when modifying `finger' data; virtually anyone with\n  internet access worldwide can query this information.  In one\n  amazing case, the New York Times writer J. Markoff uncovered the\n  identity of R. Morris, author of the Internet Worm,  through\n  the use of an anonymous tip and 'finger'.  See the book Cyberspace\n  by K. Hafner and J. Markoff.\n\n_____\n<1.5> Why is identification (un)stable on the internet?\n\n  Generally, identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept\n  on the Internet for a variety of reasons.  One is the inherent\n  fluidity of `cyberspace' where people emerge and submerge\n  frequently, and absences are not readily noted in the `community'. \n  Most people remember faces and voices, the primary means of casual\n  identification in the 'real world'.  The arbitary and cryptic \n  sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are\n  not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique\n  identification of an individual, who may use multiple accounts on\n  multiple machines anywhere in the world.\n\n  Currently internet users do not really have any great assurances\n  that the messages in email and USENET are from who they appear to\n  be. A person's mailing address is far from an identification of an\n  individual.  \n  \n  - Anyone with access to the account, e.g. they know the password,\n    either legitimately or otherwise, can send mail with that address\n    in the From: line.\n  \n  - Email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as\n    they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations. \n\n  - As part of current mailing protocol standards, forging the From:\n    line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many\n    hackers.\n    \n  The status and path information prepended to messages by\n  intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable. In general, while\n  possible, forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in\n  email.  Besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic\n  problems with today's internet protocols affecting identification\n  on the internet:\n\n  - Internet mail standards, described in RFC-822, are still evolving\n    rapidly and not entirely orderly.  For example, standards for\n    mail address `munging' or `parsing' tend to vary slightly between\n    sites and frequently mean the difference between finding\n    addresses and bouncing mail.\n  \n  - Domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites,\n    and there are delays in the propagation of this data.\n  \n  - Addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers\n    crash, such as the receiving computer or other computers involved\n    in resolving names into addresses called `nameservers'. \n  \n  - A whole slew of problems is associated with  `nameservers'; if\n    they are not updated they will not find name addresses, and even\n    the operation of what constitutes `updating' has different\n    interpretations at different sites.\n  \n  The current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly\n  anachronistic in that they were created when the network was\n  somewhat obscure and not widespread, with only a fraction of the\n  traffic it now sees.  Today a large proportion of internet traffic\n  is email, comprising  millions of messages.\n\n_____\n<1.6> What is the future of identification on the internet?\n\n  Some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images\n  and voice messages  into mail and these will improve the sense of\n  community that comes from the familiarity of identification.\n  However, they are not currently widespread, require large amounts\n  of data transfer, standardized software, and make some compromises\n  in privacy.\n\n  Promising new cryptographic techniques may make 'digital signatures'\n  and 'digital authentication' common (see below).  Also, the trend\n  in USENET standards is toward greater authentication of posted\n  information.  On the other hand, advances in ensuring anonymity\n  (such as remailers) are forthcoming.  See below.\n\n\nPRIVACY\n=======\n\n_____\n<2.1> What is `privacy' on the internet?\n\n  Generally, while `privacy' has multiple connotations in society and\n  perhaps even more on the internet, in cyberspace most take it to\n  mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the\n  data stored on and and directed to it (such as email), and you do\n  not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches.  In other words, \n  others may obtain data associated with your account, but not\n  without your permission.  These ideas are probably both fairly\n  limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users\n  consider their private domains.  Some users don't expect or want\n  any privacy, some expect and demand it.\n\n_____\n<2.2> Why is privacy (un)important on the internet?\n\n  This is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic, arousing\n  passionate opinions.  On the internet, some take privacy for\n  granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent.\n  Most governments have rules that protect privacy (such as the\n  illegal search and seizure clause of the U.S. constitution, adopted\n  by others) but have many that are antithetical to it (such as laws\n  prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping). These\n  rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules\n  governing it.  However, the legal repercussions of the global\n  internet are still largely unknown and untested (i.e. no strong\n  legal precedents and court cases).  The fact that internet traffic\n  frequently passes past international boundaries, and is not\n  centrally managed, significantly complicates and strongly\n  discourages its regulation.\n\n_____\n<2.3> How (in)secure are internet networks?\n\n  - `Theoretically' people at any site in the chain of sites with\n    access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the\n    Internet  could potentially monitor or archive it. However, the\n    sheer volume and general 'noise' inherent to this data makes\n    these scenarios highly improbable, even by government agencies\n    with supposedly vast funding and resources.\n  \n  - Technologies exist to `tap' magnetic fields given off by\n    electrical wires without detection.  Less obscurely, any machine\n    with a network connection is a potential station for traffic\n    detection, but this scenario requires knowledge and access to\n    very low-level hardware (the network card) to pursue, if even\n    possible.\n  \n  - A company Network General Inc. is one of many that manufactures\n    and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can\n    'filter' and read packets by arbitrary criteria for\n    troubleshooting purposes, but the cost of this type of device is\n    prohibitive for casual use.\n\n  Known instances of the above types of security  breaches at a major\n  scale (such as at network hubs) are very rare. The greatest risks\n  tend to emerge locally.  Note that all these approaches are almost\n  completely defused with the use of cryptography.\n    \n_____\n<2.4> How (in)secure is my account?\n\n  By default, not very.  There are a multitude of factors that may\n  reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet. \n  First, your account must be secure from other users. The universal\n  system is to use a password, but if it is `weak' (i.e. easy to\n  guess) this security is significantly diminished.  Somewhat\n  surprisingly and frighteningly to some, certain  users of the\n  system, particularly the administrator, generally have unlimited\n  access regardless of passwords, and may grant that access to\n  others.  This means that they may read any file in your account\n  without detection.\n\n  Furthermore, not universally known, most UNIX systems keep fairly\n  extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in, what\n  commands you execute, and when they are executed (in fact, login\n  information is usually public). Most features of this `auditing' or\n   `process accounting' information are enabled by default after the\n  initial installation and the system administrator may customize it\n  to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims. \n  This information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting\n  purposes and may otherwise be ignored.  This data tracks\n  unsuccessful login attempts and other 'suspicious' activities on\n  the system. A traditional part of the UNIX system that tracks user\n  commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of\n  symbolic links (described  in 'man ln').\n  \n  UNIX implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features\n  and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies\n  regularly. Typically system adminstrators augment the basic UNIX\n  functionality with public-domain programs and locally-developed\n  tools for monitoring, and use them only to isolate `suspicious'\n  activity as it arises (e.g. remote accesses to the 'passwd' file, incorrect\n  login attempts, remote connection attempts, etc.).\n  \n  Generally, you should expect little privacy on your account for\n  various reasons:\n  \n  - Potentially, every keystroke you type could be intercepted by\n    someone else. \n\n  - System administrators make extensive backups that are completely\n    invisible to users which may record the states of an account over\n    many weeks. \n\n  - Erased files can, under many operating systems, be undeleted. \n\n  - Most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or\n    otherwise; for example FTP sites usually log the commands and\n    record the domain originations of users, including anonymous\n    ones.\n\n  - Some software exacerbates these problems.  See the section on\n    ``X Windows (in)security''.\n\n  Indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users, a much\n  more commonly harmful threat. There are multiple ways to help\n  ensure that your account will not be accessed by others, and\n  compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines:\n\n  - Choose a secure password.  Change it periodically.\n  - Make sure to logout always.\n  - Do not leave a machine unattended for long.\n  - Make sure no one watches you when you type your password.\n  - Avoid password references in email.\n  - Be conservative in the use of the .rhost file.\n  - Use utilities like `xlock' to protect a station, but be\n    considerate.\n\n  Be wary of situations where you think you should supply your\n  password.  There are only several basic situations where UNIX\n  prompts you for a password: when you are logging in to a system or\n  changing your password.  Situations can arise in which prompts for\n  passwords are forged by other users, especially in cases where you\n  are talking to them (such as Internet Relay Chat).  Also, be  aware\n  that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain \n  passwords.\n\n\n  (Thanks to Jim Mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu> for contributions\n  here.)\n\n_____\n<2.5> How (in)secure are my files and directories?\n\n  The most important privacy considerations are related to file\n  rights, and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature\n  or haphazard maintenance. Be aware of the rights associated with\n  your files and directories in UNIX. If the `x' (`execute') right on\n  your parent directory is off for users, groups, and other, these\n  users cannot gain information on anything in your directories. \n  Anything less may allow others to read, change, or even delete\n  files in your home directory. The rights on a directory supersede\n  the rights associated with files in that directory. For a\n  directory, 'x' means that access to the files (or subdirectories)\n  in the directory is possible -- if you know their names.  To list\n  the contents of the directory, however, requires the 'r' right.\n \n  By default most accounts are accessable only to the owner, but the\n  initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator\n  preference.  The default file mode specifies the initial rights\n  associated with newly created files, and can be set in the shell\n  with `umask'.  The details of rights implementations tend to vary\n  between versions of UNIX.  Consult man pages on `chmod' and `ls'.\n\n  Examples\n  --------\n\n    traver.lance % ls -ld ~\n    drwx------ 15 ld231782     1536 Jan 31 21:22 /users/ld231782/\n\n  Here is a listing of the rights associated with a user's home\n  directory, denoted by `~'.  The columns at the left identify what\n  rights are available. The first column identifies the entry as a\n  directory, and the next three columns mean that read, write, and\n  execute rights, respectively, are permitted for that user.  For\n  directories, the `x' right means that contents (file and\n  subdirectory names) within that directory can be listed. The\n  subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to\n  anything in the directory tree originating at that point.  They\n  can't even `see' any lower files or subdirectories; the hierarchy\n  is completely invisible to them.\n\n    traver.lance % ls -l msg\n    -rw-r--r--  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg\n    traver.lance % chmod u=rw,g=,o= msg\n    traver.lance % ls -l msg\n    -rw-------  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg\n\n  Here the modes on the file `msg' were changed to take away rights\n  from `group' and `other'. \n  \n  Note that `ls -l <file>' requires both the 'r' right to get the list\n  of files and subdirectories, and the 'x' right to access the files\n  and subdirectories in order to get their size, etc. For example,\n  suppose the directory `foo' has rights dr--r--r--,  the following\n  is possible:\n\n    ls foo\n\n  These commands would fail independent of file rights:\n  \n    ls -l foo\n    ls -l foo/file\n    cat foo/file\n    cd foo\n\n  If the directory `foo' has rights d--x--x--x, the following are\n  possible if it is known beforehand that `foo' contains an 'r'\n  readable file named `file':\n  \n    ls -l foo/file\n    cat foo/file\n    cd foo\n  \n  The following commands fail:\n  \n    ls foo\n    ls -l foo\n  \n\n  (Thanks to Uwe Waldmann <uwe@mpi-sb.mpg.de> for contributions here.)\n\n_____\n<2.6> How (in)secure is X Windows?\n\n  X Windows is the primary software developed by the MIT Athena\n  project which is funded by U.S. government grants to develop\n  applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing\n  computational tasks, particularly the human-computer interface. \n  The software implements a client-server interface to a computer via\n  graphical windows. In this case the `client' is the application\n  requesting or utilizing  graphical resources (such as windows or a\n  mouse) and the `server' is the machine that provides them.  In many\n  situations the client is an application program running on the same\n  machine as the server.\n\n  The great utility of X Windows comes from its complete dissociation\n  of the client and server so that windows may be `broadcast' to a\n  server at a remote location from the  client. Unfortunately this\n  dynamic power also introduces many deep, intricate, and complicated\n  security considerations.  The primary security and privacy issue\n  associated with X Windows is that much more sensitive data may be\n  sent over a network, and over wider regions, than in the case where\n  the human is situated near the host computer.  Currently there is\n  no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in X\n  Windows.\n\n  Due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design\n  flaws,  early versions of the X Window system are extremely\n  insecure. Anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt\n  that display or read it electronically based on access to the\n  device unix:0.0 by any regular user.   There are no protections\n  from this type of access in these versions.   The problem arises\n  because the security is completely based on machine addresses\n  rather than users, such that any user at a `trusted' machine is\n  himself trusted. Quoting from X documentation (man Xsecurity):\n  \n  > Any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed\n  > access to the X server. This system can work reasonably well in\n  > an environment where everyone trusts everyone, or when only a\n  > single person can log into a given machine...This system does not\n  > work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and\n  > mutual trust does not exist. \n  \n  With the access control list, the `xhost' command may prevent some\n  naive attempts (i.e. those other than the direct-access unix:0.0\n  evasion); the syntax as typed on the host machine is  ``xhost\n  +[name]'' where [name] is the domain name or internet address of an\n  authorized client machine. By default clients running nonlocal to\n  the host are disabled.  Public domain programs to disrupt a display\n  momentarily (such as 'flip' or slowly mirror the screen image, or\n  cause pixels to 'melt' down to the bottom) have been circulating on\n  the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks\n  on unsuspecting or inexperienced users.  Much more serious security\n  breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this\n  inherent weaknesses.  (The minimal, easily-bypassed `trusted'\n  security mode of `xhost' has been jokingly referred to as ``X\n  Hanging Open, Security Terrible.''). \n\n  New versions of the X Window system (X11R5 and higher) by default \n  make server access as secure as the file system using a .Xauthority\n  file and 'magic cookies'.  Remote machines must have a code in the\n  .Xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code\n  allowed by the server.  Many older programs and even new\n  vendor-supplied code does not support or is incompatible with\n  `magic cookies'. The basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to\n  monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of\n  keys occurs in transmission.  X11R5 also includes other\n  sophisticated encryption mechanisms.  Try `man Xsecurity' to find\n  out what is supported at your site.  Even though improved security \n  mechanisms have been available in X Windows since ~1990, local\n  sites often update this software infrequently because installation\n  is extremely complex.\n\n\n  (Thanks to Marc Vanheyningen <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>, \n  Jim Mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu>, and Bill Marshall\n  <marshall@cs.iastate.edu> for contributions here.)\n\n_____\n<2.7> How (in)secure is my email?\n\n  By default, not very.  The characters that you are reading are\n  almost certainly encoded in ASCII, the American Standard Code for\n  Information Interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic\n  characters onto numeric codes and vice versa.  Virtually every\n  computer system uses this code, and if not, has ways of converting\n  to and from it.  When you write a mail message, by default it is\n  being sent in ASCII,  and since the standard is virtually\n  universal, there is no intrinsic privacy.  Despite milleniums worth\n  of accumulated cryptographic knowledge, cryptographic technologies\n  are only recently being established that afford high priority to\n  privacy as a primary criteria in computer and network design.  Some\n  potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows:\n\n  - The most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous\n    system operators reading private mail in the `spool files' at a\n    local site (i.e. at the source or destination of the message),\n    such as a university. \n  \n  - System administrators may also release files to law enforcement\n    agencies, but conventions and protocols for warrants involving\n    computer searches have still not been strongly established and\n    tested legally.\n\n  - Note that bounced messages go to postmasters at a given site in\n    their entirety.  This means that if you address mail with an\n    incorrect address it has a good chance of being seen by a human\n    other than the recipient.\n\n  - Typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local\n    mail directory is private, but this is not guaranteed and can be\n    overridden.\n\n  - Finally, be aware that some mailing lists (email addresses of \n    everyone on a list) are actually publicly accessable via mail \n    routing software mechanisms.  This `feature' can be disabled.\n\n  Most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly\n  avoided with the use of strong end-to-end cryptography, which has\n  its own set of caveats (for example, unscrupulous administrators\n  may still be a threat if the encryption site is shared or\n  nonlocal).  See the sections on ``email privacy'' and ``email\n  policies.''\n\n_____\n<2.8> How am I (not) liable for my email and postings?\n\n  As punishment or whatever, your system administrator can revoke\n  certain `privileges' such as emailing, USENET posting or reading\n  certain groups, file transferring, remote communications, or\n  generally any subset of capabilities available from your account. \n  This all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator\n  and under the procedures followed at a particular site, which in\n  many cases are haphazard and crisis-oriented.  Currently there are\n  virtually no widespread, uniform guidelines or procedures  for\n  restricting use to any internet services, and local administrators\n  are free to make arbitrary decisions on access.\n\n  Today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations.\n  In the typical scenario complaint(s) reach a system adminstrator\n  regarding abuses by a user, usually but not necessarily preceded by\n  complaints to the user in email, regarding that person's\n  objectionable email or postings.  `abusive' posters to USENET are\n  usually first given admonitions from their system administrators as\n  urged by others on the `net'. (The debate persists endlessly on\n  many newsgroups whether this is also used  as a questionable means\n  of attacking or silencing `harmless crackpots' or censoring\n  unpopular opinions.)\n  \n  System administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to\n  'squelch' severe cases of abuse.  In general, however, by tradition\n  Usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of\n  the system, but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe\n  their alternatives when this patience is sapped: the options\n  wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next\n  message (referred to as ``hitting the `n' key''), or to `plonk'\n  annoying posters (according to the Hacker's Dictionary, the sound a\n  jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file).\n\n  In cases where punitive actions are applied, generally system\n  administrators are least likely to restrict email.  USENET postings\n  are much more commonly restricted, either to individual users or \n  entire groups (such as a university campus).  Restrictions are most\n  commonly associated with the following `abuses':\n\n  - harassing or threatening notes, `email terrorism'\n  - illegal uses, e.g. piracy or propagation of copyrighted material\n  - `ad hominem' attacks, i.e. insulting the reputation of the\n    poster instead of citing the content of the message\n  - intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness\n  - inappropriate postings, esp. binary files in regular groups\n    `mail-bombing': inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive\n    files\n\n  Major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and\n  official email or postings.  Most users have internet access via\n  accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the\n  internet can be construed as representative of their parent\n  organizations. Many people put disclaimers in their `signatures' in\n  an attempt dissociate their identity and activities from parent\n  organizations as a precaution. A recent visible political case\n  involves the privacy of electronic mail  written by White House\n  staff members of the Bush administration.  Following are some\n  guidelines:\n\n  - Acquaint yourself with your company or university policy.\n  - If possible, avoid use of your company email address for private\n    communication.\n  - Use a disclaimer.\n  - Keep a low profile (avoid `flamewars' or simply don't post).\n  - Avoid posting information that could be  construed to be\n    proprietary or `internal'.\n\n  The following references are available from ftp.eff.com\n  (see also the section on ``internet use policies''):\n\n  /pub/academic/banned.1991\n  /pub/academic/banned.1992\n  ---\n    Computer material that was banned/challenged in academia in 1991\n    and 1992 including USENET hierarchies.\n\n  /pub/academic/cases\n  ---\n    This is an on-line collection of information about specific\n    computers and academic freedom cases. File README is a detailed\n    description of the items in the directory.\n\n  /pub/academic/faq/netnews.liability\n  ---\n    Notes on university liability for Usenet.\n\n_____\n<2.9> How do I provide more/less information to others on my identity?\n\n  The public information of your identity and account is mostly\n  available though the UNIX utility `finger' described above. \n  \n  - You have control over most of this information with the utility\n    `chfn', the specifics vary between sites (on some systems use\n    `passwd -f').\n   \n  - You can provide unlimited information in the .plan file which is\n    copied directly to the destination during the fingering. \n    \n  - A technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is\n    'finger'ing you and even to  vary the .plan file sent to them.\n    \n  - Your signature is determined by the environment variable SIGNATURE\n    \n  - USENET signatures are conventionally stored in the .signature file\n    in your home directory.\n    \n  Providing less information on your online identity is more difficult\n  and involved.  One approach is to ask your system adminstrator to\n  change or delete information about you (such as your full name). \n  You may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from\n  someone unrelated to you personally.  You may be able to remotely\n  login (via modem or otherwise) to computers that you are not\n  physically near.  These are tactics for hiding or masking your\n  online activities but nothing is foolproof.  Consult man pages on\n  the 'chmod' command and the default file mode.  Generally, files on\n  a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very\n  little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators.\n\n  To mask your identity in email or on USENET you can use different\n  accounts. More untraceable are new `anonymous posting' and\n  remailing services that are very recently being established.  See\n  below.\n\n______\n<2.10> Who is my sysadmin?  What does s/he know about me?\n\n  The requirements and screening for getting a system administration\n  job (and thereby access to all information on a system) vary widely\n  between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax, especially at\n  universities.  Many UNIX systems at universities are largely\n  managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often\n  `hacking'.  In general, commercial and industrial sites are more\n  strict on qualifications and background, and government sites are\n  extremely strict.\n\n  The system adminstrator (root user) can monitor what commands you\n  used and at what times.  S/he may have a record (backups) of files\n  on your account over a few weeks. S/he can monitor when  you send\n  email or post USENET messages, and potentially read either.  S/he\n  may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using,\n  both locally and elsewhere.  Administrators sometimes employ\n  specialized programs to  track `strange' or `unusual' activity,\n  which can potentially be misused.\n\n______\n<2.11> Why is privacy (un)stable on the internet?\n\n  For the numerous reasons listed above, privacy should not be an\n  expectation with current use of the internet.  Furthermore, large\n  parts of the internet are funded by the U.S. NSF (National Science\n  Foundation) which places certain restrictions on its use (such as\n  prohibiting commercial use).  Some high-level officials in this and\n  other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to\n  guarantee privacy (such as encryption and anonymous services).\n\n  Historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been\n  local. Perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread\n  occurrences of university administrators refusing to carry some\n  portion of USENET newsgroups labelled as `pornographic'. The\n  `alternative' hierarchy in the USENET system, which has virtually\n  no restrictions on propagation and new group creation, is\n  frequently targeted (although this material may appear anywhere).\n\n  From the global point of view traffic is generally completely\n  unimpeded on the internet  and only the most egregious offenders\n  are pursued.  For example,  verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted\n  material (such as newspaper or magazine articles) are posted to\n  USENET with regularity without major consequences (some email\n  complaints may ensue).  More astonishing to some is that currently\n  significant portions of USENET traffic, and less so internet\n  traffic, is comprised of sexually-explicit digitized images almost\n  entirely originating from copyrighted material (newsgroups such as\n  `alt.sex' regularly have the  highest traffic).\n  \n______\n<2.12> What is the future of privacy on the internet?\n\n  Some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or\n  appropriate level of privacy.  Others will argue that as a\n  prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate\n  safeguards.  The internet is growing to become a completely global,\n  international superhighway for data, and this traffic will\n  inevitably entail data such as voice messages, postal mail, and\n  many other items of extremely personal nature. Computer items that\n  many people consider completely private (such as their local hard\n  drives) will literally be inches from global network connections.\n  Also, sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged\n  over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with\n  the internet.\n  \n  Most would agree that, for these basic but sensitive uses of the\n  internet, no significant mechanisms are currently in place to\n  ensure much privacy. New standards are calling for uniform\n  introduction of `privacy enhanced mail' (PEM) which uses encryption\n  technologies to ensure privacy, so that privacy protection is\n  automatic, and may significantly improve safeguards.\n\n  The same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy\n  (such as with  surreptitious surveilance) can be overwhelmingly\n  effective in protecting  it (e.g. with encryption). Some government\n  agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general, and believe\n  that it should lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct\n  (e.g. court-authorized wiretapping).  However, powerful new\n  technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming\n  increasingly popular, provoking some to say that ``the cat is out\n  of the bag'' and the ``genie can't be put back in the bottle''.  In\n  less idiomatic terms, they believe that the spread of strong\n  cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically\n  unstoppable.\n  \n  To date, no feasible system that guarantees both secure\n  communication and government oversight has been proposed (the two\n  goals are largely incompatible). Proposals for ``registration'' of\n  secret keys (by D. Denning on sci.crypt, for example) have been met\n  with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst,\n  mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections\n  of inherent feasibility.  Electronic privacy issues, and\n  particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet, will\n  foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few\n  years.\n\n\nANONYMITY\n=========\n\n_____\n<3.1> What is `anonymity' on the internet?\n\n  Simply stated, anonymity is the absence of identity, the\n  ultimate in privacy. However, there are several variations on\n  this simple theme.  A person may wish to be consistently\n  identified by a certain pseudonym or `handle' and establish a\n  reputation under it in some area, providing pseudo-anonymity.\n  A person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single\n  one-way message (a sort of `hit-and-run'). Or, a person may\n  wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with\n  others (with either known or anonymous identities) via an\n  `anonymous return address'.  A user may wish to appear as a\n  `regular user' but actually be untraceable.  Sometimes a user\n  wishes to hide who he is sending mail to (in addition to the\n  message itself). The anonymous item itself may be directed at\n  individuals or groups.  A user may wish to access some\n  service and hide all  signs of the association. \n  \n  All of these uses are feasible on the internet but are currently\n  tricky to carry out in practice, because of all the tracking\n  mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols. \n  Officials of the NSF and other government agencies may be opposed\n  to any of these uses because of the potential for abuse. \n  Nevertheless, the inherent facelessness of large networks will\n  always guarantee a certain element of anonymity.\n\n_____\n<3.2> Why is `anonymity' (un)important on the internet?\n\n  Anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or\n  problematic depending on its use.  Arguably absence of\n  identification is important as the presence of it.  It may be the\n  case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be\n  discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted, because true\n  anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish.\n\n  One can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague\n  that would sabotage a relationship if stated openly (such as\n  employer/employee scenarios).  One can use it to pass information\n  and evade any threat of direct retribution.  For example,\n  `whistleblowers' reporting on government abuses (economic, social,\n  or  political) can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or\n  retaliation. Sensitive, personal, potentially damaging information\n  is often posted to some USENET groups, a risky situation where\n  anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely\n  independent of the identities of the participants.  Some police\n  departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of\n  crimes; such uses would be straightforward on the network.\n  Unfortunately, extortion and harassment become more insidious with\n  assurances of anonymity.\n\n_____\n<3.3> How can anonymity be protected on the internet?\n\n  The chief means, as alluded to above, are masking identities in\n  email and posting. However, anonymous accounts (public accounts as\n  accessable and anonymous as e.g. public telephones) may be\n  effective as well, but this use is generally not officially\n  supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and NSF\n  guidelines.  The nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining\n  accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous\n  accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large.\n\n  Many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to\n  anonymity.  Virtually every protocol in existence currently\n  contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet.\n  New communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee\n  much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication.\n\n_____\n<3.4> What is `anonymous mail'?\n\n  One approach to `anonymizing' mail has been to set up an `anonymous\n  server' that, when activated by email to its address, responds by\n  allocating and supplying an `anonymous ID' that is unique to the\n  person requesting it (based on his email address).  This will vary\n  for the same person for different machine address email\n  originations. To send anonymous mail, the user sends email directed\n  to the server containing the final destination. The server\n  `anonymizes' the message by stripping of identification information\n  and forwards the message, which appears to originate from the\n  anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id. \n  This is the `interactive' use of anonymity or pseudonymity\n  mentioned above.\n\n  Another more `fringe' approach is to run a `cypherpunk' remailer\n  from a regular user account (no root system privileges are\n  required). These are currently being pioneered by  Eric Hughes and\n  Hal Finney <hal@alumni.caltech.edu>. The operator runs a process on\n  a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain\n  characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail\n  (typically fields in the header). One has been implemented as a \n  PERL script running on UNIX.  Several of these are in existence\n  currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable;\n  they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge.\n  The remailers don't generally support anonymous return addresses. \n  Mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator. \n  Generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any\n  responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system,\n  although actually may be held liable regardless.\n\n  These approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses:\n  \n  - The anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of\n    anonymous ID's to real addresses that must be maintained\n    indefinitely.  One alternative is to allow `deallocation' of\n    aliases at the request of the user, but this has not been\n    implemented yet.\n\n  - Although an unlikely scenario, traffic to any of these sites could\n    conceivably be monitored from the `outside', necessitating the\n    use of cryptography for basic protection,.\n\n  - Local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or\n    under pressure from local, network, or government agencies.\n  \n  - Unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic\n    that goes through them.\n\n  - Most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected. \n\n  - The cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these\n    operators are basically  network users who do not own the\n    equipment and are accountable  to their own system\n    administrators, who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic\n    to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered,\n    regarding it as illicit use. \n\n  - In all cases, a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous\n    server operator by the user.\n\n  Currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using SMTP\n  protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary\n  field information.  This practice, not uncommon to hackers, and the\n  approach used by remailers, is generally viewed with hostility by\n  most system administrators.  Information in the header routing data\n  and logs of network port connection information may be retained\n  that can be used to track the originating site.  In practice, this\n  is generally infeasible and rarely carried out.  Some\n  administrators on the network will contact local administrators to\n  request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished\n  more severely (such as revoking the account), all of this actually\n  happening occasionally but infrequently.\n\n  See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and \n  ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.\n\n_____\n<3.5> What is `anonymous posting'?\n\n  Anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous Usenet\n  posting with all the associated caveats above (monitored traffic,\n  capricious or risky local circumstances, logging).  Make sure to\n  test the system at least once by e.g. anonymous posting to\n  misc.test (however some operators don't recommend this because many\n  sites `autorespond' to test messages, possibly causing the\n  anonymous server to allocate anonymous IDs for those machines). \n  See the ``responsibilties associated with anonymous posting''\n  before proceeding.\n\n  Another direct route involves using NNTP protocols to submit a\n  message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information.\n  This practice, not uncommon to hackers, is also generally viewed\n  with hostility by most system administrators, and similar\n  consequences can ensue.\n\n  See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and \n  ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.\n\n_____\n<3.6> Why is anonymity (un)stable on the internet?\n\n  As noted, many factors compromise the anonymity currently available\n  to the general internet community, and these services should be\n  used with great caution.  To summarize, the technology is in its\n  infancy and current approaches are unrefined, unreliable, and not\n  completely trustworthy.  No standards have been established and\n  troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software\n  are prevalent.  Here are some encountered and potential bugs: \n  \n  - One  anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous\n    return addresses. \n  - Others passed signature information embedded in messages\n    unaltered. \n  - Address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced\n    to a remailer are common.\n  - Forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem,  possibly\n    allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon ID - email\n    address  mappings in the alias file.  This can be remedied with\n    the use of passwords.\n  - Infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers.\n  \n  Source code is being distributed, tested, and refined for these\n  systems, but standards are progressing slowly and weakly.  The\n  field is not likely to improve considerably without  official\n  endorsement and action by network agencies.  The whole idea is\n  essentially still in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and\n  distrust by many on the internet, seen as illegitimate or favorable\n  to criminality.  The major objection to anonymity over regular\n  internet use  is the perceived lack of accountability to system\n  operators, i.e. invulnerability to account restrictions resulting\n  from outside complaints.  System adminstrators at some sites have\n  threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the\n  prominent servers from their redistribution flows.  This may only\n  have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less\n  characteristically detectable headers.  Probably the least\n  problematic approach, and the most traditional to Usenet, is for\n  individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer,\n  e.g. ignoring it or filtering it with kill files.\n  \n_____\n<3.7> What is the future of anonymity on the internet?\n\n  New anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase\n  safeguards of anonymity.  For example, the same mechanism that\n  routes email over multiple hosts, thereby threatening its privacy,\n  can also be used to guarantee it. In a scheme called `chaining' an\n  anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers\n  before reaching a destination.  In this way generally multiple\n  links of the chain have to be `broken' for security to be\n  compromised. Re-encryption at each link makes this scenario even\n  more unlikely.  Even more significantly the anonymous remailers\n  could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses\n  (such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation)\n  would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message\n  tracing. However, remailers run by corrupt operators are possible.\n  \n  The future of anonymous services on the internet is, at this time,\n  highly uncertain and fraught with peril. While specific groups seem\n  to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities, many\n  feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a\n  disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in\n  `serious' groups.   The introduction of unlimited group anonymity\n  may have fundamental repercussions on Usenet conventions and\n  distribution mechanisms such as moderated and `alt' groups have had\n  in the past. For example, as part of new group creation, the\n  charter may specify whether `anonymous' posting is (un)welcome. \n\n  Nevertheless, the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may\n  be inevitable. Based on traffic statistics, anonymous services are\n  in huge demand. Pervasive and readily available anonymity could\n  carry significant and unforeseen social consequences.  However, if\n  its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may\n  be confined to the underground.  The ramifications of widespread\n  introduction of anonymity to Usenet are still largely unknown. It\n  is unclear whether it will provoke signficant amounts of new\n  traffic or, instead of expansion, cause a shift where a greater\n  portion of existing traffic is anonymized.  Conceivably the\n  services could play a role in influencing future mainstream social\n  acceptance of Usenet.\n\n\n* * *", "label": 11}

{"text": "\n\n\nApparently you *didn't* read the whole thing.  You continue to miss the point.\n\n\n\n[deletions]\n\n\n\nCounselling that only provides alternatives to abortion would be just as\nbiased as counselling that only provides *abortion* information.  How about\nproviding counselling that will give a woman help in finding what *she* is\ncomfortable with.\n\nYour adoption-funding idea may be a good one.  Any idea if it is feasable?\n\n\n\n\nMaking adoption easier on the birth-mother may help reduce abortion, but\nit will *not* eliminate the need for it.  Abortion is not done just because\nthe mother can't care for the child and doesn't feel good about giving it\nto strangers.  Abortion is done because the mother can not afford the\n*pregnancy*.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen please justify why being \"human\" automatically makes something valuable.\nAnd why that includes the unborn.\n\n\n\n\nNo, they are not guaranteed to become productive members of society.  Even\nif they do that is *MANY YEARS* in the future--until which they are a burden\non someone, or society.  There is also the matter of the mother.  Forcing\nher to carry a pregnancy to term at a critical time in her life could prevent\nher from being a productive member of society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOk, look.  It's like this.  We *are* footing the bill.  Maybe they will\ntake choice A.  Maybe they will take choice B.  Maybe they will take choice\nC.  They can't afford any *one* of them.  If they take choice A we'd have\nto pay them, say $5.  If they take choice B it would cost us $20.  If they\ntake choice C it will cost us $20 now and a hell of a lot more for the next\n18 years.  Which one sounds the most realistic for us to be willing to pay\nfor?  Now some people happen not to like choice A.  Other people happen\nnot to like choice C (paying for it, that is).  C has been around and paid\nfor for years.  Even though it means we spend a lot of money, we can't in\nconscience refuse to pay for it.  Now A has been around and is perfectly\nlegal, but it hasn't been funded in the past.  Now A is going to be funded\nbut some people object.  They don't like the idea of their tax money going\nto pay for choice A.  So we could refuse to fund A at all.  Then those\nwomen who can't afford any of those choices will be forced to take choice\nB or C, which will cost *all of us* more money.  Most of us don't see any\nreason at all why *more money* should be spent to the effect of *removing\npersonal choice* from some women.  The alternative is to fund A if that is\nwhat the mother chooses.  We will also still fund B and even C if *that*\nis what the mother chooses.  However, some women will certainly choose A,\nand that will then save us $15 we otherwise would have had to spend.  Your\n\"taxes\" are not being raised to fund a choice you object, they are being\n*lowered* because we will fund a choice that is *legal*, despite your\nobjections to it.  (Actually, your taxes are not really going to go down,\nas I'm sure you would point out.  But the amount that is saved in that\narea can help out in another--like our massive debt.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThose other procedures you mention only cost money.  There is no savings\nin other procedures that would be required down the road without them.\n(In fact, there could be additional costs down the road *because* of them.)\nThis is quite different from the case of abortion.\n\n\nThis is bullshit.  We are *not* refusing \"to make the alternative affordable\ntoo\".  If we refused to pay for the more expensive choice of birth, *then*\nyour statement would make sense.  But that is not the case, so it doesn't.\nIf Clinton tried to block funding for pre-natal care and delivery (or left\nit out of his health-care plan), I would certainly object.  I would also be\nquite surprised.\n\n\n\nYes, but probably not your definition of it, or for the reasons you think.\n\n\nYOU STUPID FUCK!  *WE DO* want to fund *all* the choices.  *YOU* are the\none who wants to *NOT* fund all the choices.\n\n\nYour humble opinion is still wrong.  Even with easy adoption, there is still\nthe fact that pregnancy takes several months.  Months in which a young woman\ncould need to be getting an education.  (like finishing High School, entering\ncollege, finishing college, getting a job...things that are much harder to\ndo if you have to \"take a break\" for a few months...things that have a massive\nimpact on her future productivity.)\n\n\n\n\nYou *can* have a conversation with the \"mentally incompetant\".  And even\nthough *you* personally may refuse to have a conversation with \"people\nyou just don't like\", it is still *possible* for others to have a conversation\nwith them.  It is *not* possible for *anyone* to have a conversation with\na fetus.\n\n\n\nHe was still biologically independent.  At least to the same extent you are\nnow.  He consumed nutrients and digested them in the normal manner.  He\nbreathed his own air.  A fetus on the other hand, gets it's nutrients already\ndigested by the mother.  It gets its oxygen from the mother as well.  That\nis not biologically independent.\n\n\n\nAwareness is only *part* of what makes a \"member of society\".  It is the\nminimal conceivable requirement, yet many people seem to think that something\nwithout awareness could still be important enough to justify the suffereing\nof a true member of society.  I keep asking, but I still haven't seen a real\njustification for why the life of a non-sentient creature should be worth the\nsuffering of a sentient being.

{"text": "Some of the MD's in this newsgroup have been riding my butt pretty good\n(maybe in some cases with good reason).  In this post on depression, I'm \nlaying it all out.  I'll continue to post here because I think that I have \nsome knowledge that could be useful.  Once you have read this post, you \nshould know where I'm coming from when I post again in the future.\n\n \nLida,\nI can emphasize with your situation.  Both my wife and I suffered from \nbouts of depression.  Her's was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a \nrebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and \nchemotherapy.  Lida, I used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through \nher six months of chemotherapy(with the approval of her oncologist).  When \nsevere depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped, I tried to \nuse supplements to bring her out of it.  I had \"cured\" her PMS using \nsupplements and I really thought that I knew enough about the role of diet \nin depression to take care of her depression as well.  It didn't work and \nshe was put on Prozac by her oncologist.  Two Winters ago(three years after \nby wife's breast cancer) I got hit with severe depression(pretty typical and \none reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another \nstressor).  I tried to take care of it for several months with \nsupplementation.  Didn't work.  My internist ended up putting me on Prozac. \nI was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using \nB6, niacin, folate and B12 to \"cure\" depression.  I'm not going to do that \nbecause all you would be doing is flying blind like I was.\n\nLida, I do believe that depression can have a dietary component.  But the \nproblem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use \nan approach which will \"fix\" the problem.  For chemotherapy, I knew exactly \nwhat drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be \naffected.  Same thing for PMS.  I was flying blind for both of these \nstressors but the literature that I used to devise a treatment program was \npretty good.  Depression is just too complicated.  What you really need is \na nutritional scan.  This is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your \nbodies nutrient reserves.  For every vitamin and mineral(except vitamin C), \nyou have a reserve.  The RDA is not designed to give you enough of any \nnutrient to keep these reserves full, it is only designed to keep them from \nbeing emptied which would cause clinical pathology.  Stress will increase \nyour need for many vitamins and minerals.  This is when your reserves become \nvery important.\n\nLida, without your permission, I'm going to use your post as a conduit to \ntry to explain to the readers in this group and Sci. Med. where I'm coming \nfrom.  I have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the Osteopathic \nMedical schools for ten years now.  I've written my own textbook because \nnone was available.  What I teach is not a rehash of biochemistry.  I \npreach nutrient reserves(yes my lectures in this course are referred to by \nmy students as sermons).  Here is what I cover:\n\nIndroduction and Carbohydrates \t\t\tLipids\n\nProteins I\t\t\t\t\tProteins II\n\nEnergy Balance\t\t\t\t\tEvaluation of Nutritional\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStatus I, A Clinical \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPerspective\n\nEvaluation of Nutritional Status II,            Evaluation of Nutritional\t\t\nA Biochemical Perspective\t\t\tStatus III, Homework \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAssignment Using the \n\t\t\t\t\t\tNutritionist IV Diet and \n\t\t\t\t\t\tFitness Analysis Software \n\t\t\t\t\t\tprogram\n\nWeight Control\t\t\t\t\tFood Fads and Facts\n\nAge-Related Change in Nutrient Requirements\tFood Additives, \n\t\t\t\t\t\tContaminants and Cancer\n\nDrug-Nutrient Interactions\t\t\tMineral and Water Balance\n\nSodium, Potassium and Chloride\t\t\tCalcium, Magnesium and \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPhosphorus\n\nIron\t\t\t\t\t\tZinc and Copper\n\nIodine and Fluoride\t\t\t\tOther Trace Minerals\n\nVitamin A\t\t\t\t\tVitamin E\n\nVitamins D and K\t\t\t\tVitamin C\n\nThiamin and Niacin\t\t\t\tRiboflavin and Pyridoxine\n\nPantothenic and Folic acids\t\t\tBiotin and B12\n\nOther Nutrient Factors\t\t\t\tEnteral Nutrition\n\nParenteral Nutrition\n\nEvery three years I spend my entire Summer reviewing the Medical literature \nto find material that I can use in my nutrition textbook.  I last did this \nin the Summer of 1991.  I read everything that I can find and then sit down \nand rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books \nthat have 217, 237 and 122 pages.  Opposite each page of written text(which \nI write myself) I've pulled figures, tables and graphs from various \ncopyrighted sources.  Since this material is only being used for \neducational purposes, I can get around the copyright laws (so far).  I can not \nsend this material out to newsgroup readers(as I've been asked to do).\n\nI am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition \nassessment lab.  This is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that I need \nto make my education program complete.  This lab will let me measure the \nnutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to \nbe required in humans.  The Mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to \ndesign supplement programs for their cancer patients.  Cancer Treatment \nCenters of America, which is a private for-profit organization with \nhospitals in Illinois and Oklahoma(Tulsa) also operates a \nnutritional assessment clinical lab.  I also believe that the Pritikin \nClinic in California has a similiar lab setup.\n\nFor physicians reading this post, I would suggest that you get the new \nClinical Nutrition Textbook that has just been published(Feb) by Mosby.  I \nhave been using Alpers Manual of Nutritional Therapeutics(a Little Brown \nseries book) as a supplemental text for my course but Alpers is geared more \nto residency training.  Two M.D's have written this new Clinical Nutrition\ntextbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it \ndoes a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a \npatient's nutritional status.  Let me quote a few sentences from the \nPreface of this new text:\n\n\"So-called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists, \nhematologists, or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge \nof nutrition as it related to their field of practice.\"  \n\n\"Unfortunately, about two thirds of the medical schools in the United \nStates require no formal instruction in nutrition.\"\n\n\"But times and medical practice have changed.  More than half of the \nleading causes of death in this country are nutrition related.\"\n\n\"... this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives: (1) it \nshould complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of \nnutrition to your medical practice; and (2) it should heighten your \nawareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important \nfor both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially \nevery organ system.\"\n\nRoland L. Weinsier, MD, DrPH \n\nLida, my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find \na physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals\n(yes even magnesium may play a role in depression) play in depression and \nwho could get a nutritional profile run.  Menopause is often a time when \nwomen suffer depression.  There are a lot of hormonal changes that are \noccuring but they are not the same ones that occur during PMS.  A \nnutritionist may also be able to help.  Not too long ago a poster mentioned \nthat his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red \ncell glutathionine peroxidase test(the specific test for the selenium \nreserve).  Most clinical labs will not run this test and I advised him to \ntry to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified.  There are \nalso a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral \nanalysis but these labs are not regulated.  Checks of these labs using \ncertified standards, and also those doing water lead analysis, showed some \npretty shoddy testing was going on.  If you or anyone else finds someone \nwho will run these speciality nutrition tests, make sure that they are \nusing a lab that has been certified under CLIA(the Clinical Laboratory \nImprovement Act).  \n\nA diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown \nto correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging \nand software analysis(Nutritionist IV and other software programs).  But \nthere are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not \nshow a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status.\nUntil we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the \nU.S. and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional \nprofile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses \ndiet changes and supplementation, anti-depressants will probably continue \nto be the best approach to depression.\n\nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine", "label": 13}

His\n1988 season is pretty decent for a rookie 2B.  The move to\nthird base explains a lot of his 1989.  When he returned as an OF,\nhe began hitting again.  And of course, last year he slumped.\n\nBut no learning curve?  He has obviously improved his batting eye\nover the years, as well as his SB/CS ratio.  As to his fielding,\nhe was an infielder when he was drafted, a 2Bman as he came\nup through the Braves system, and then the Braves put him through\n2 position changes in the space of a year.  He's an adequate OF,\nalthough not great, and at least some of your perception of his\nfielding is colored by watching him learn to play the OF at the\nML level.  (I know you're another long-term Braves fan :)\n\nAbout playing 3B...IMO, that's the 2nd most DIFFICULT position\nto field, after catcher.  At SS or 2B, you need more range and \nspeed, but at 3B, you've got to have quick reflexes and have \na GUN for an arm.  There are NO second chances at 3B, even when\nplaying sandlot softball!  Granted, I'd still put my best\noverall infielder at SS, but that's because he gets more\nchances, not because the job is harder.  It still amazes me\nthat so many teams have tried to convert other position players\nto 3B.  But maybe that's because the supply of \"natural\" 3B is\nscarce.\n\nFinally, Gant is a player who puts pressure on himself to\nperform well, and works hard to improve.  You don't get\nthose amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without a\nlot of weight work.  Now, whether he's been overdoing it these\ndays may be a valid question, as is the question of whether\nhe tries too hard to make something happen during each at-bat.\nBut frankly, if a player is going to not live up to potential,\nI'd much rather they fail by trying too hard, than by not\ntrying hard enough.  You might be able to teach relaxation\nto an adult; but at that age I don't believe you can teach\nhustle.\n\nAll that said, I don't think I'd sign Gant to another long-term\ncontract.  He's 28 now, and I think he's free-agent eligible\nin 2 years, when he'll be 30.  Given his career curve and\nlimitations, I wouldn't expect him to last much past 35\nas a ML ballplayer.  He might surprise me here, but Atlanta's\ngot some talent on the farm, and I'd rather take my chances\ndown the road with Nieves et al.", "label": 9}

The illumination's excellent that way, with a full beam coming\nout from the level of the motor (left side); the lamp beam is linear so\nthat you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right, and it \nreally picks up the periphery (deer lurking, etc.)  Combined with the \nheadlamp on high you can see like day.

I invariably flood the carbs, then go in and read a section\nof the paper, and then she starts right up.

That's kinda like taking someone on a no-show 10-way\nspeed star competition as their first skydive.\n\n}This person is <100 lbs. and fairly small, so I don't see weight as too much\n}of a problem, but what sort of of advice should I give her before we go?\n}I want her to hold onto me  :-)   rather than the grab rail out back, and\n}I've heard that she should look over my shoulder in the direction we're\n}turning so she leans *with* me, but what else?  Are there traditional\n\n1) If the Ninja has adjustable suspension, adjust it to a stiffer\nsetting so you don't bottom out in bumpy curves.\n\n2) Tell her the 3 cardinal rules are:\n\na) NEVER EVER EVER EVER put her feet down. Not when you stop at a STOP\nsign, not when she thinks you're gonna crash, never. Keep them on the\npegs until you tell her to get off the bike.\n\nb) She is to hold onto your waist. She should hold on tightly enough\nthat she won't slide off the bike if you twist the throttle a bit. And\n(added bonus for you here), she should keep as close to your butt as\npossible so quick stops don't make her slide into you and knock your\nballs up onto the gas tank. You decide how best to word this.\n\nc) Just stay perpendicular to the bike; straight up in the seat. Don't\nlean your body into curves, just go with the bike and stay perpendicular.\nDon't look over your shoulder.*\n\n3) Remember at all times that you have a passenger on the back. That\nmeans don't pop the clutch, and try to corner and stop smoother than\nusual. Be aware that if you jump on the brake, you're going to have\nthe equivalent of a 100 lb. dead weight crashing into you from behind,\nso be prepared for that.\n\n4) Make sure she pisses before the ride even if she says she doesn't\nhave to go. No anti-women stuff here; I have a tiny bladder myself.\n\n5) Remind her to look around while you're riding. Point to things\nof interest. It makes the ride more enjoyable to her (she won't get\nso focused on just looking at the back of your helmet), and it gives\nher ample excuse to squeeze you to show she saw what you pointed at.\n\n* My wife and I tried the MSF-recommended \"look over the rider's\nshoulder in curves\" bit, and it just didn't work. The timing of\nher weight shift was unpredictable (especially on the Maxim because,\nunlike the Ninja, the upright riding position really restricts the\npillion's view of the road ahead). Next time I had her just remain\nperpendicular to the bike, and I could hardly tell there was someone\nelse on the bike in curves, and she weighs substantially over 100 lbs.", "label": 8}
{"text": "\n\nThere are a lot of people running around saying \"God told me this\" and \n\"God told me that\" these days.  Some people really have heard God, and others\nheard their glands.  Mario Murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once.  He\nsaid someone told him, \"The Lord gave me a song.\"  He said that it was\nthe worst song he had ever heard.\n\n\"I know why he gave you that song,\" Murillo said, \"He didn't want it anymore.\"\n\nBut God does still speak to His people today, and the idea is contrary to the\nidea of a closed cannon.  Ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the Spirit\nin the church of His day (2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the first\nto put forth a New Testament cannon, which was almost identical to the one\nwe have today.  He believed in a closed cannon.  \n\nMany prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the Scriptures.\nFor example, one prophet in Kings, whose name starts with an \"M\" who\nprophecied that the king would lose a battle.  That is the only prophecy\nhe gave recorded in Scripture, and we no that he had given other prophecies\nbecause the king complained before he heard the prophecy, \"He never prophesies\nanything good about me.\"  Yet only one little paragraph of all of his \nlifetime of prophecies are recorded in Scripture.  There are numerous examples.\nBarnabas was a prophet, Acts says, before he was even sent out as an \napostle.  Yet his writings are not recorded in Scripture.  Only two of\nAgabus prophecies are mentioned in Scripture.  He was already a prophet\nbefore he gave them.  \n\nSo prophecy may be genuine and from God, but that does not make it \nScripture.  \n\n\nI don't know about translations of Scripture, but I am familiar with \nprophecies that give applications for Scripture.  There are also \nsimilar examples in the Bible.  Several times Peter interprets prophecies\nin a seemingly prophetic way, for example, \"And his bishoprick let another\ntake\" concerning Judas office.\n\nA clearer example can be found in Matthew 24.  Jesus is prophesying about\nwhat will happen before His return and He quotes a passage out of Joel\nabout the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood.  So Scriptural\nprophecy can be used in later prophecy.  \n\nSometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge,\nbut gifts of the Spirit seem to overlap.  Words of knowledge and wisdom\ncan overlap.  The word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap.  \nInterpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy.  Healings are often\nconsidered miracles.  So sometimes the distinction between gifts is a \nbit hazy.  Imho, it doesn't usually matter that much if we are able to\nlabel a phenomenon, as long as we recognize them as the work of the \nSpirit, and use them according to His leading.", "label": 15}

{"text": "From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: Gaza and separation from Israel\n\n\nGaza and the idea of separation\n\nThe Israeli Left's inability to cope with the challenges it is\npresented with by reality becomes obvious at those moments when\nthe reality does not line up with the expectations of the left. We\nwere able to see this clearly during the Gulf War.  Because of the\nPalestinian's popular solidarity with Iraq, Yossi Sarid -\ncurrently Minister of the Environment - made his infamous\nstatement: \"You look for me !\", i.e., I'am not making any more\nefforts to speak with you. From Yossi Sarid's point of view,\nPalestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfew\nor the danger of hunger it brought with it, but whether or not the\nPalestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party. Similarly\nMERETZ, MK Deddi Tzuker, recently faced with criticism from\nresidents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over his\ngovernment's and his party's lack of action for human rights and\npeace, responded by asking those present at the discussion whether\nthey would rather have a Likud government. From the Leftists'\nperspective this is the best government because it is THEIR\ngovernment, regardless of what it does.\n\nThese members of the Israeli Left have already decided how the\nfuture of the Occupied Territories will look, and they want to\ndictate to the Palestinians how to get there. An essential step\ntowards this future is their participation in Yitzhak Rabin's\ngovernment, and from their point of view the expulsions were a\nmarginal byproduct of this \"government of peace\", which need not\ndisturb the routine course of events. Likewise the \"Rabinic\"\npolicies in Gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rockets\nand the significant increases in the number of persons injured in\nthe suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it.\n\nBut the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces\nitself upon them when a mob in Gaza falls upon a settler who has\nlost his way, when a settler is stabbed by his Palestinian\nworkers, or when a Palestinian knifes people in the streets of Tel\nAviv. Then all hell breaks loose and the Israeli Left has nothing\nto propose except separation: Let's cut ourselves off from the\nPalestinians, let's build a fence so high that they won't be able\nto harm us - this is the cry of the Israeli Left. Let us erect a\nfence between us and the reality whith is the occupation.\n\nMeron Benvenisti writes about this in Ha'aretz (4-3-93): \"...The\nliberal Left. which does not differentiate between physical\nseparation and 'the future of the territories', must come to\nunderstand that the regime of magnetic cards, exclusion of Arab\nworkers, closure, and curfew are instruments of enforcement\ndesigned for the suppression of a population in revolt, and that\ntheir ideological support for separation only provides\n'humanitarian' arguments for the legitimization of the <status\nquo>.\n\nEnforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the\nruling community, but it is only the ruled population which bears\nits burden. [.....].\n\n\"Whoover thinks that 'out of Gaza first' is a liberal,\nhumanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether\nthis position is also moral. It is very easy to shake off\nresponsibility for this concentration of human suffering, and to\nthus also disregard responsibility for it's creation. It is very\neasy to erect a fence between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in\nJerusalem, when this fence has a gate - the keys to which are at\nthe disposal of one hand - which opens to allow the Jews to pursue\nall their interests, but is barred to the Arabs...\".", "label": 17}

{"text": "KS> From: keith@actrix.gen.nz (Keith Stewart)\nKS>My wife has become interested through an acquaintance in Post-Polio Syndrome\nKS>This apparently is not recognised in New Zealand and different symptons ( eg\nKS>chest complaints) are treated separately. Does anone have any information\n\nI'm not sure that this condition is \"recognised\" anywhere (in the\nsense of a disease with diagnostic criteria, clear boundaries\nbetween it and other diseases, unique pathologic or physiologic\nfeatures, etc), but here goes with what many neurologists agree on.\n\nPost-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease\nby clinical examination, EMG, and muscle biopsy.  The abnormalities\nare mostly chronic (due to old polio) but there is evidence of\nongoing deterioration.  Clinically, the patients complain of\ndeclining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks.\nMusculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless\ncontributes to the impaired performance.  The examination shows\nmuscle weakness and atrophy.  The EMG shows evidence of old\ndenervation with reinnervation (giant and long-duration motor unit\naction potentials) *and* evidence of active denervation\n(fibrillation potentials).  The biopsy also shows old denervation\nwith reinnervation (fiber-type grouping) *and* evidence of active\ndenervation (small, angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme\nstaining) - but curiously, little or no group atrophy.\n\nPost-polio patients do not have ALS.  In ALS, there is clinically\nevident deterioration from one month to the next.  In post-polio,\nthe patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one\nyear to the next.  Of course, there are patients who had polio\nbefore who develop genuine ALS, but ALS is no more common among\npolio survivors than among people who never had polio.\n\nThe cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown.  There is little\nevidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus or\ndestructive immunologic response to virus antigen.\n\nThere is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio have\nanything different happening to the motor unit (anterior horn cells,\nmotor axons, neuromuscular junctions, and muscle fibers) than\npatients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration.\nBoth groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings.  The reason\nfor these \"acute\" changes in a \"chronic\" disease (old polio) is\nunknown.  Possibly spinal motor neurons (that have reinnervated huge\nnumbers of muscle fibers) start shedding the load after several\nyears.\n\nThere are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-polio\nsyndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny\ndeterioration.  The PPS patients are more likely to have had severe\npolio.  The PPS patients are *much* more likely to complain of pain.\nThey also tend to score higher on depression scales of\nneuropsychologic tests.\n\nMy take on this (I'm sure some will disagree):  after recovery from\nsevere polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles, tendons,\nligaments, bones, and joints, that leads to inflammatory and/or\ndegenerative conditions affecting these structures.  The increasing\npain, superimposed on the chronic (but unchanging) weakness, leads\nto progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL.  I am\nperhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPS\npatient who was not limited in some way by pain.  I do not believe\nthat PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than\nnon-PPS patients (i.e., those with old polio of similar severity but\nwithout PPS complaints).", "label": 13}

This was the age of\n  nationalism among the Christian subjects of the Sultan, starting with\n  the Greek Revolution early in the nineteenth century, which, based on\n  the Megali Idea, or Great Idea, sought to add to Greek kingdom Istanbul\n  and large portions of Anatolia, union of which with Greece was felt to be\n  the 'dream and hope of all'. The success of the Greek national movement,\n  provided more in fact by the intervention of the Great Powers than by the\n  efforts of the Greeks themselves, stimulated similar uprisings among the\n  other subjects in Southeastern Europe who had long been oppressed, not so\n  much by the Ottomans but, rather, by the Greek religious hierarchy which\n  dominated the Orthodox millet, leading first to pressure for religious\n  independence, granted to the Bulgarian Orthodox Exarchate in 1870, to the\n  Serbian Church in 1879, and to the Rumanian Church in 1885, with subsequent\n  aspirations for, and achievement of, political independence following...>>\n\n  page 188:\n\n  <<...They [new nationalist leaders] were greatly assisted in their\n   campaigns against the Ottomans both by the diplomatic and consular\n   representatives of the major Powers of Europe and also by Christian\n   missionaries, who emphasized feelings of Christian superiority and\n   hatred for Muslims and Jews which fortified the religious as well as\n   ethnic bases of their pursuit of independence.\n\n   Christian nationalism, based as much on religious as on ethnic identity,\n   soon resurrected the medieval bigotries which had devastated both Jews\n   and Muslims and consequently had driven them together in the past.\n   Vicious anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic movements developed, involving\n   large-scale persecutions and massacres carried out by invading armies,\n   by the independent states that resulted, also by Christian subjects\n   who remained within the Empire, particularly because of Jewish and Muslim\n   support for Ottoman integrity in fear of their fate in the emergent\n   nationalist states of Southeastern Europe. The results were explosive\n   and damaging.\n\n   The invading armies of Russia and Austria as well as the revolting\n   nationalists and, later, successfully established independent Christian\n   states, committed systematic genocide against Jews and Muslims throughout\n   the nineteenth century, despite Great Power admonitions to the contrary\n   in the treaties of Paris (1858) and Berlin (1878),...>>\n\n  page 188:\n\n  <<...As the peoples of Southeastern Europe achieved their independence,\n   their Muslim and Jewish minorities were systematically persecuted and\n   massacred, and those who survived were driven beyond the ever-shrinking\n   boundaries of the retreating Ottoman Empire in a kind of slaughter which\n   had not been seen since the dispersal of the Jews from Palestine centuries\n   earlier.\n\n   This sort of genocide had begun as long before as the late sixteenth\n   century, with the Rumanian Principalities taking the lead, as united\n   Rumania did subsequently during the later years of the nineteenth\n   century. In 1579 the ruler of Moldavia, Peter the Lame, banished its\n   Jews because of their competition with its Christian merchants. When\n   Prince Micheal the Brave revolted against the Ottomans in the Rumanian\n   principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia in 1593, he ordered the massacre\n   of all the Jews as well as Turks in Bucharest.>>\n\n  page 189:\n\n  <<The slaughter continued well into the nineteenth century. When the\n  Greeks revolted against Ottoman rule many Greek volunteers coming from\n  Russia and the Principalities to join in the effort slaughtered and\n  plundered the Jewish communities along their paths as they went through\n  Moldavia and Wallachia toward Greece.>>\n\n  page 190 (second paragraph):\n\n  <<When Venice occupied the island of Chios in 1694, its Jewish population\n   was either massacred or deported and all Jewish communal and personal\n   property was stolen by the native Greek population, leaving those Jews\n   who returned in utter poverty and reduced to begging, no longer able to\n   compete with the Greeks in trade or commerce.>>\n\n  page 190 (third paragraph):\n\n  <<Jews living in Greece and the Rumanian principalities suffered terribly\n   because of their support for Ottoman rule. When the Greek nationalist\n   movement Philike Etairia started its uprising in Wallachia and Moldavia\n   during the spring of 1821, hundreds of Jews and Muslims were killed by\n   the Greeks who lived there as well as by native Wallachs [14]. During\n   the height of the Greek revolution, five thousand Jews were massacred\n   in Morea along with most of the Muslim population, numbering about\n   twenty thousand in all [15]. In Tripolizza alone 1,200 Jews were\n   massacred along with uncounted Turks [16].  Reverend John Hartley,\n   after describing the carnage, concluded 'Thus did Jewish blood, mingled\n   with Turkish, flow down the streets of captured city. The sons of Isaac\n   and the sons of Ishmael, on this as well as on every occasion during the\n   Greek Revolution, met with common fate. Their corpses were cast out of the\n   city, and, like the ancient sovereign of Judah, they received no burial\n   superior to that of an ass.' [17] Jewish communities on the islands of\n   Sparta, Patras, Corinthos, Mistra, and Argos were wiped out by bands of\n   Greek rebels along with those of Thebes, Vrachori, Attica and Epirus [18].\n   The surviving Jews fled to the island of Corfu, where Jews who had fled\n   from Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula had lived in peace and prosperity\n   under the Venetian rule since the twelfth century, though divided into\n   rival Greek and Italian communities. It was not long, however, before\n   it too fell victim to the Greek Revolution, leading to savage repression\n   and massacres of Jews, forcing the surviving members of the two communities\n   to come together for self-defense for the first time. Throughout the years\n   of Greek revolution, Greek nationalists went from town to town on the\n   mainland and from island to island in the Agean, exterminating all the\n   Jews and Muslims they could find, many along the roads as they desperately\n   fled to safety in what was left of the Ottoman Empire. Contemporary\n   accounts relate that the Greeks left the murdered Jews and Muslims lying\n   exposed so their bodies could be torn apart by the buzzards [19]. Most of\n   the Jews who survived these massacres fled across the Agean in small boats\n   to Izmir, thus starting its rise as one of the leading centers of Ottoman\n   Jewish life during the nineteenth century. Only in Northern Greece,\n   particularly in the areas of Janina and Salonica, were the Jews and the\n   Turks able to successfully resist the Greek assaults, thus saving their\n   populations from massacre as well [20]. During the remainder of the 19th\n   century, particularly during the Greek-Turkish war in 1897, those Jews\n   who remained in Greece in the areas of Athens, Chalkis, Larissa, Corfu\n   and Crete suffered severe persecution and massacre, forcing thousands\n   more to emigrate into Ottoman territory, particularly to Salonica and\n   Izmir [21].>>\n\n   page 193 (last paragraph):\n\n   <<The inclusion in the Treaty of Berlin of stipulations providing\n   protection for the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Southeastern Europe\n   stimulated more popular anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim hysteria in all\n   the countries involved, with blood-libel accusations once again being\n   used as pretexts for attacking and ravaging Jewish quarters as well as\n   for new tactics for boycotting Jewish shopkeepers, merchants and\n   professionals, a movement which was quickly adapted by the Christian\n   millets in the major cities of the Ottoman Empire. Because the Bulgarians,\n   Rumanians and Greeks correctly regarded the Jews as supporters of the\n   Turks, both Jews and Turks were expelled from these countries in equally\n   atrocious and brutal manners. Their property was plundered and their\n   homes and shops taken over without compensation, while the survivors\n   fled in desperation to Edirne and Istanbul. While official statements\n   subsequently were issued granting equal rights to Jews, little was done\n   in fact and they continued to be persecuted regularly well into the\n   twentieth century.>>\n\n  page 194 (last paragraph):\n\n  <<Things were not much better elsewhere in Southeastern Europe or the\n   Greek islands of the Agean and the eastern Mediterranean. In 1891 the\n   Jews on Corfu were subjected to severe persecution by local Greeks due\n   to the revival of the old ritual murder accusations [26]. Many of\n   those who survived found refuge in Ottoman territory with the help of a\n   popular subscription drive carried out in Istanbul under leadership of\n   the Banque Camondo. In 1881 and 1884, and again in 1892 and 1903,\n   thousands of Jews came to Ottoman territory as a result of pogroms\n   in Russia which went on between 1881 and 1921 with only slight periods\n   of respite. In 1899 Jewish families arrived in Istanbul in flight from\n   persecution in Vidin, in independent Bulgaria.\n\n   The conquest of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia by Greek and Bulgarian\n   forces during the Balkan Wars (1912-13), including Salonica, Corlu,\n   and Edirne, was followed by general attacks on Jews, their synagogues,\n   homes and shops, in both countries [27], resulting in a renewed exodus\n   toward Istanbul and beyond. Two reports from Salonica graphically\n   described the situation caused by the invading armies:\n\n      'All the self-interested justifications of the newspapers of Europe,\n      all the lies which they have used to cover up the truth, can never\n      destroy the impression of the terrible anguish which has marked the\n      entry of the Greeks in Salonica. A week of terror and horror one can\n      never easily forget. The Hellenes now cruelly feel today all the\n      damage that the explosion of hatred by the (Greek) population has done\n      to their cause. The mob has shown itself odious and the government\n      weak...The incompetence of the Greek administration and the horrors\n      inflicted by the soldiers has put them in a terrible situation. The\n      consuls guaranteed the absolute safety of the Muslims, but sixty of\n      them were massacred in a single night....'[28]\n\n     'It wasn't only irregulars (Comitacis) who massacred, pillaged and\n      burned. The soldiers of the Army, the Chief of Police, and the high\n      civil officials took an active part in the events at Serres. Out of\n      6,000 houses, 4,000 were burned. Almost 1,200 shops were consumed by\n      flames and destructive bombs. The (Jewish) population lost all, and\n      without even anything to wear is in despair. Everyone wants to\n      emigrate...'[29]\n\n\n  page 196:\n\n    <<As a result of these assaults, massacres, and forced deportations from\n   the independent countries of Southeastern Europe, the Ottoman Empire\n   received literally thousands of Jewish refugees who joined the Muslims\n   who survived the persecution, flooding into the Empire...>>\n\n[14] Shlomo Rozanes, Korot Hayehudim Beturkiyah Vebeartzot Hakedem:\n    Hadorot Haachronim (Jerusalem, 1945), pp.42-44, cited Yitzchak Kerem,\n    'The Influence of Anti-Semitism on Jewish Immigration Patterns from\n    Greece to the Ottoman Empire in the 19th Century', pp.2, 14.\n\n[15] Maxime Raybaud, Memoires sur la Grece, pour servir a l'histoire de la\n    Guerre de l'Independence (2 Vols, Paris, 1824), pp.5-19; Galante,\n    Turcs et Juifs (Istanbul, 1932), 76-77.\n\n[16] Rev.

{"text": "Brian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered \"paid advertising\" but rather\n\"public relations\", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis \"advertising\" as much as it is \"public relations\", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980's which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than \"public relations\", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie \"The Last\nAction Hero\".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it \"would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation.\"   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a \"commercial launch\" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL \"BILLBOARDS\"\n   Orbital \"billboards\" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in \"The Man Who Sold the Moon\".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the \"Eiffel\nII\" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic's Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)", "label": 14}

{"text": "\nI have the same problem.  I have looked at Motif++, WWL, InterViews, GINA++,\nand a few variations on the above.  I've also done a cursory examination\nof Rogue Wave's View.h++.  I like View.h++'s abstractions best of all of the\ntoolkits I mentioned, but the resulting code looks little like Motif, and I\nhave little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result\nin significant longevity for my code.  GINA++ allows you to write code which\nlooks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance,\nbut the resulting code is almost too Motif-like, and is certainly not\nsignificantly less verbose than equivalent C code.  InterViews looks\npromising, but I haven't found a free version with Motif support, and I'm\nnot confident how widely InterViews with Motif support will be adopted,\nand what (if any) specific Motif support will be available over time.  The\nother libraries produce code which is less Motif-like, but which does not make\nsufficient use of the features of C++ to simplify my coding task.\n\nAt this point, my inclination is to write my Motif manipulation routines in\nC, and invoke those routines from my C++ code using simple abstractions suited\nto my specific task.  Later, if OSF or some credible standards-setting body\ncomes up with a C++ interface to Motif, I will change to that.  It does me\nno goo to write in C++ if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which\nleaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry\ndirections.  It's better to take a standard if inferior solution for now\nthan to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both\nuseless code and useless skills a few years from now.  Views.h++ is the only\nlibrary I'd consider right now, but in our environment, we'd end up spending\nnearly $5000 to use it, and I can't justify it when it's likely to cause\nshort-term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction, and is\nunlikely to be a sufficiently long-lived solution for us to reap the benefits\nat the high end of the J curve.\n\n- Brad", "label": 5}

As soon as you possibly can.  The\ndifference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery\nand a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-variety\ndoctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally,\nany hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in\nthese kinds of problems.  DON'T WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.\n\nThe remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, from\na wonderful report by New Zealand's Department of Labour (Occupational\nSafety and Health Service): \"Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment and\nRehabilitation: A Practitioner's Guide\".\n\nFirst, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn't have your hands):\n(note: you're likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :)\n\n  RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries\n  OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI\n  CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI\n  WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI\n  CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below)\n  Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint.\n  Pronation: Turning the palm down.\n  Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up.\n  Supination: Turning the palm up.\n  Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down.\n  Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil.\n  Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger.\n  Power grip: The grip used for a hammer.\n  Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb.\n  Abduction: Moving away from the body.\n  Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide.\n\nNow then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse\nconditions.  Local problems are what you'd expect: specific muscles,\ntendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt.\nDiffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle\ndiscomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of\ntenderness in muscles, although they're not necessarily \"the problem.\"\n\n--- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here's the theory.\n\nNormally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which\npass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrict\nthe blood flow.  By the time you're exerting 50% of your full power,\nyou're completely restricting your blood flow.\n\nWithout fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out,\nthen they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates\nnasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.\n\nOnce one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the\nload.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes\nthings worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow,\nand the cycle continues.\n\nAnother by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from\nyour nerves.  They need blood too.\n\nAnyway, when you're typing too much, you're never really giving a change\nfor the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never\nrelax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poor\nergonomics, only make things worse.\n\n--- Specific injuries you may have heard of:\n\n(note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute\ninjuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have\nless pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)\n\nTenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis\noccurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to\ncause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's ability\nto lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets\ninflamed, and you've got your problem.\n\nTendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon\ncan cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating,\nand can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more\nswelling, and more pain.  \"Sub-acute\" tendonitis is more common, which entails\na dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse\nwith repetitive activity.\n\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your\nfingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include\nfeeling \"pins and needles\", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation.\nCTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.\n\nAdverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as 'neural tension', this is where\nthe nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly\ncompressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere.\nAMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS \ndisorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy \n(brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).\n\nOthers: for just about every part of your body, there's a fancy name for\na way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOS\nconditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors\nmisdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, you\nmay have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion\nbefore somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).\n\n==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment\n\nThe most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce\ntension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax.\nIf you're under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune out\nthe world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding\nprinciple in your work: every three minutes take a three second break.\nEVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it every\nthree minutes.  It's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings,\ncalm down, and relax.\n\nIf you can't sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, and\nrelaxation are really a big deal.\n\nThere are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduce\ninflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad\nposture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen\nyour muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture\nand a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold\ncontrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what's best\nfor you.\n\n--- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this was\nwritten in the New Zealand book that I'm lifting it almost verbatim from\nAppendix 10. -- dwallach]\n\n. Let your shoulders relax.\n. Let your elbows swing free.\n. Keep your wrists straight.\n. Pull your chin in to look down - don't flop your head forward.\n. Keep the hollow in the base of your spine.\n. Try leaning back in the chair.\n. Don't slouch or slump forward.\n. Alter your posture from time to time.\n. Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.\n\nSet the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There \nshould be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees,\nand your thighs should not slope too much.\n\nNow, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable\nto work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedy\nis to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a\nfootrest.\n\nNow, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space\nbetween the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in\nthe hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this\narea.\n\nIf you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning\nback, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available.\n\n[Now, I diverge a little from the text]\n\nA good chair makes a big difference.  If you don't like your chair, go\nfind a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angle,\nback height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in\nthe way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm\nrests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good\nstore and play with all these chairs -- pick one that's right for you.\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend \"Just Chairs.\"  The\nname says it all.\n\n--- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements:\n\nThere is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some\npeople, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, you\nshouldn't be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your\nkeyboard to be \"right there\".  If you drop your arms at your side and then\nlift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands\nwhen your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoid\npronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads\nmay or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and\nlook at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  It's\noften easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or\ndeviated hands.\n\nSome argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly\ndesigned.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, today.\nCheck out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail.\n\n==5== Requests for more info\n\nClearly, the above information is incomplete.  The typing-injury archive\nis incomplete.  There's always more information out there.  If you'd like\nto submit something, please send me mail, and I'll gladly throw it in.\n\nIf you'd like to maintain a list of products or vendors, that would be\nwonderful!  I'd love somebody to make a list of chair/desk vendors.  I'd\nlove somebody to make a list of doctors.  I'd love somebody to edit the\nabove sections, looking for places where I've obviously goofed.\n\n==6== References\n\nI completely rewrote the information section here, using a wonderful\nguide produced in New Zealand by their Occupational Safety & Health\nService, a service of their Department of Labour.

Since then, I have received a grant from Science\nCulture Canada, a division of Supply and Services Canada to research the\nbook. Since my old posting the book has evolved into an educational book\nfor kids aged 9 - 14 (though this may change again) It will have about\n40 two-page spreads with a large graphic in the middle and text/graphic\nboxes all around on the following subjects: Vital statistics and photo of\nthe scientist, Personal statement from the scientist, Narrative of a few\nmoments in the life of the scientist, \"What I was doing when I was 12\",\nSo you want to be a <insert kind of scientist>, Experiment you can do. There \nwill be an appendix with 100 - 200 more scientists with one paragraph\nbiographies who didn't quite make it to the double spreads.

It's 1024x768, up to 72hz at\nthat res, and it got a good write-up for image quality in a recent (Feb.?)\nissue of PC Magazine.  As far as I know, very little fully matches a NEC in\nimage quality (at least according to the mags -- I can't tell any\ndifference between the two!), but I think NEC is low emissions on only one\nof the two types.  There's VLF (Very Low Frequency) and ELF (I think that's\nExtremely Low Frequency).  The MPR-II standards set strict limits on both.\nBut many comapnies, NEC included according to one article I read (I get a\nbunch of mags so it's hard for me to remember which!), which claim \"low\nemissions\" but not specifically \"MPR-II Compliant\" or \"MPR-II Certified\"\nonly control for one, usually VLF, and ignore the other.\n\tSo, the NEC probably has higher overall image quality (I consis-\ntently hear it rated as the best or close to the best), but not as low\nemissions as the Hitachi.

{"text": "\n\n\n\nHere's a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference station\nwith a very exactly known position computes the errors in the\nincoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors\nincluding atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time\ndithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational \nequipment to \"back out\" the errors in its position (since it knows\nwhere it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a \nbroadcast which is available to any number of relatively local\nreceivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using\nthe same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very\nsimilar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the\nreceiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference\nunit.\n\nThe US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series\nof coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will\nuse existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately\n305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals\non different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers\ncorrection signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system\nwhich has stations all across the US.\n\nThe correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format.\nAdvertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJohn P.

The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\n   version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\n   I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\n   (for better or for worse).\n\n   I pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\n   a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where\n   the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\n   a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\n   station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\n   frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\n   5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\n\n   I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\n   card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\n   imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\n   keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\n   to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\n   \"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\n   frames.\n\n   I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\n   for the results I'd been reporting earlier.\n\n   Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\n\n   That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\n   test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\n   disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\n   was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\n   (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\n\n   I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\n   scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\n   size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\n   observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\n   action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's\n   entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\n\n   Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\n\n   The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\n   \"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\n   from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).\n   A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was\n   very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\n   ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this\n   much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task\n   switching.\n\n   A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see\n   any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\n   stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\n\n   I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\n   key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\n   improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\n   even more...\n\n   Lawrence D'Oliveiro                       fone: +64-7-856-2889\n   Computer Services Dept                     fax: +64-7-838-4066\n   University of Waikato            electric mail: ldo@waikato.ac.nz\n   Hamilton, New Zealand    37^ 47' 26\" S, 175^ 19' 7\" E, GMT+12:00\n\n\nI'm afraid I missed the start of this thread, but there are three factors that\ncan significantly affect QuickTime's playback speed that you may want to take\ninto account:\n\n(1) playback bit depth (things are fastest when you play a\nmovie back at the bit depth it was compressed for, this is usually 8 or 16\nbit, but other depths are (of course) possible).\n\n(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for \"double size\" scaling, other scaling\nfactors hit peformance much harder).\n\n(3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices\nto advantagous pixel boundaries by default, I'm not sure about Premiere).\n\nAny combination of those can radically alter playback performance.  Image size\nis, of course, another biggie.  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also\nmake a real difference.\n\nForgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread...\n\n-Peter Lee\n\n ", "label": 1}

{"text": "I will try to answer some of Dorin's questions, even though they were\nnot addressed to me specifically, but I feel that I am a bit concerned\nby the thread since I am a Southern Lebanese from a village that is \noften on the receiving end of Israel's bombs.\nIn the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied\nLebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or murder.  It is \ndisingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich\nor any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed \nsolely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.\nIt seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problem\non the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant,\nand heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation.\nI will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of\nwhat the situation really is in South Lebanon.\n\n\n\nI am.  I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your information\nwe are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the \npeople in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily\nbusiness, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are\nolder men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard to\nimagine ????  It is NOT a \"terrorist camp\" as you and the Israelis like \nto view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer\nin the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....\nSOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\nthe Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not \nknow who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\nsuspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\nsupported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\nammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\nfor Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\nby these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\nof their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\nare back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\nan 8 year old girl just happened to be.\nWe are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is \nthe Israeli way of telling us that \"if you're gonna hurt our soldiers\nyou're gonna pay the price\".  We accept this as a price we have to pay\nto free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting\nthe resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather\njust keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young \nmen to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are\ntaking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers.\nIsrael's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\nwe have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\non the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \nISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \nleverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\nThe people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a \nregular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that\nthe so called \"Security Zone\" is necessary for the protection of \nNorthern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation\nwith the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,\nthan it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the \nestablishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect\nour villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the\nbest policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the\nestablishment of peace keeping troops along the border.\n\nI have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only\nreal solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace\nsettlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and\npeace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure\nno one on either side of the border is shelled.\nThis is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\nrealize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\nits northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\nIsraeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\nwould have resulted in.  \nIf Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw \nunilaterally from the so-called \"Security Zone\" before the conclusion\nof the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,\nadvance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel's \npublic image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations \nsince Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in \npeace and has already offered some important concessions.\nAlong with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah\nbe disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not \naccept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a\nshelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone\nand will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.\nThere seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\ngoovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \ncircumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\ncapable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\nin all other parts of Lebanon.\n  \n\nI agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\nCANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\n\n I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make\n\nYes, we have no quarrel with Jews, or Israeli civilians.\nThe real problem is with OCCUPYING Israeli soldiers and those brave\nIsraeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an \noccupying soldier is attacked.\n \n", "label": 17}

However, I also had not been looking for that information.\nI can see what I can find...\n\nI can tell you that haldol is an antipsychotic drug, and, according to\nthe Nursing93 Drug handbook, it is \"Especially useful for agitation\nassociated with senile dementia\"  (p. 400).  It also should not be \ndiscontinued abruptly.  It did not say anything about long lasting\neffects.\n\nBecause so many things can cause confusion, it is hard for me to know\nwhat else was going on at the time; if I had more history, i might be able\nto answer you better.

{"text": "-> > This mention of a well regulated militia is what confuses me.  According\n-> > to the Federalist Paper's, a well regulated militia has a well defined \n-> > structure and follows nationally uniform regulations.\n-> \n-> Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!\n\nPerhaps you should, reread Federal 29 which deals exclusively with the\n\"well regulated malitia.\"  Here is what is says about its character:\n\n\t To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes\n\t of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through\n\t military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to\n\t acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the\n\t character of a well-regulated militia, \n\nIt also talks about the \"well regulated militia\" having a nationally\nuniform in structure and disipline.  \n\nI will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states:\n\n    \tLittle more can reasonably be aimed at, with\n\trespect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed\n\tand equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it\n\twill be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of\n\ta year.\n\nBut, do you knew how much organization is required to training a large\ngroup of poeple twice a year.  Just to try to get the same people\nevery year, provide a basic training to new people so they can\nbe integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it \nrequires a continually standing committee of organizers.  \n\nSince a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and\ndisipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claim\na \"well regulated militia\" is not well organized.  But I will concide \na \"well organized militia\" is not necessarily a \"well regulated militia.\" \n\nSeveral people have stated that the \"well organized militia\" is\nwhat is defined under 10 USC 311, which states\n\n\tThe militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied \n\tmales at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in \n\tsection 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, \n\tor who have made a declaration of intention to become, \n\tcitizens of the United States and of female citizents of \n\tthe United States who are commissioned officers of the \n\tNational Guard.\n\nThis deos define the militia, but were is the adjective \"well regulated.\"\n10 USC 311 does not define a \"well regualed militia\" in any way, shape, \nor form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia\nThe Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the \"well regualed militia\" as a\nproper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above, it\ntalk above \"disciplining all the militia of the United States\" so they\nfit the \"character of a well-regulated militia.\"  This is what the\nparagraph states about the associated costs:\n\n\tIt would form an annual deduction from the productive labor \n\tof the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the \n\tpresent numbers of the people, would not fall far short \n\tof the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all \n\tthe States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the \n\tmass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,\n\twould be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not \n\tsucceed, because it would not long be endured.\n\n\nAnother quote provide by Charles Scripter is:\nJames Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the \"General Welfare\" clause): \n\t\"Nothing is more natural nor common than first\n\tto use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a\n\trecital of particulars.\"\n\nSo the phrase \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall \nnot be infringed\" must either qualify or explain the phrase \"a well \nregulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.\"  \nThe definition of \"explain\" as stated in \"The American Hertitage\nDictionary of the Enlish Language\" The New College Edition, 1982 is:\n\t1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from;\n\t   elucidate: \"It was the economists who undertook to explain \n\t   this puzzle\"\n\t2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan.\n\t3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for' justify:\n\t   explain an error\nThe second phrase clearly does not \"explain\" the first, therefore\nthe second phrase must \"qualify\" the first.  The definition given\nfor \"qualify\" is:\n\t1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities\n\t   of; characterize.\n\t2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or \n\t   task.\n\t3) To give legal power to; make legally capable.\n\t4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions.\n\t5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate\n\t6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase)\nSince \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be\ninfringed\" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything and\nit has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task.\nBy process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since\n#3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, it\nmust be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore, \"the right \nof the people to keep and bear Arms\" gives legal power to the \"well \nregualated militia\" and this legal power \"shall not be infringed\".  \n\nI thank you very much Mr Scripter, you have provided me with more \nevidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the \npeople's right to form well regulate militia, and says very little \nabout the right of an untrained person to \"keep and bear\" a .50 caliber\nmachine gun.  And since I, totally untrained in the use of any firearm\n(something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gun\nsafety course and joining a gun club), cannot legally buy such a machine\ngun, I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with\nme.\n\n-> So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy\n-> our Liberties and Rights.\n\nI mean \"to destory our Liberties and Rights.\"  Is that why a participate\nin the discussion of exactly what \"our Libertues and Rights\" are?  I \nforce my version of \"our Liberties and Rights\" by begining statements\nof what \"our Liberties and Rights\" with \"All that the Second Amendment \nclearly states to me.\"   Using expressions, such as \"states to me,\" \nclearly mean I intend to force my views on others?  I don't think so.\n\nSo in effort not to force my views and not \"to destory our Liberties and\nRights,\"  I state that nothing I have written, or will write, in\nthe matter of \"Liberties and Rights\" is the final word.  For I am only\none person among many and the final word on \"Liberties and Rights\" cleary\nand irrevocably belongs to the many.", "label": 16}

{"text": "So far Simmons looks like a total idiot.\n\n\n1) Zane Smith should learn how to \"switchpitch\" and return from the DL. I\nwould rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all.\n\n2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an\nimpressive win last week. NOw Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmon's\nreputation. Now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had the\nAL's highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted's sake), I hope he\npitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.\n\n3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently.\nBUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have\nshown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little\nbit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters.\nMerced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration at\nthe plate in his rookie year.\n\n4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think that\nWalk desrved his contract.\n\n5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I\ncan't understand his and management's fear of losing Tom Prince through\nwaivers. Even if they do, what's the use. He is aright hander like Slaught.\nNot a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him\nway too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught\nshould have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed\npitching). Didn't Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to\ntrade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere\nwasn't very fit last year.\n\n6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!!\n7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the\nseason. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other\nthan the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks,\nPatterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have\npitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money\non Patterson in stead.\n\n8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.\n\n9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.\n10) Slaught: How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? NOw his\nvalue has increased immensely.\n\n11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.\nLet's see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better.\nNow why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better\nthan a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.\n\n12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement\nin favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that\nidiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.\n13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The\nRF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace\ntwo of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a\nvery respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have\na respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit\nleft handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options\nfor the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon's tenure was\ngetting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.\n\n14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave.\nthey will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed.\nNow, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots,\nnothing else will.\n\nOn a final note. Tim Wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 2\nstarts. BUt don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of\nthe season. Also, if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the\nseason, they will miss Redus's clutch hitting and his speed(he has peaked\nin the second half of the last 2 seasons)>\n", "label": 9}

{"text": "\nYep, that's pretty much it. I'm not a Jew but I understand that this is the\nJewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between\nYHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral\nCode to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries\nfall, though.\n\nAs I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was\nrequired, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that\nthe Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of\nthe required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).\n\nThe essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between\nMan and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate\nanything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).\n\n\nThe trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the \"created\nin His image\" means. I've heard a number of different opinions on this and\nhave still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if\none wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors\nunashamedly!) As to living by Christ's example, we know very little about\nJesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives\nby his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians.\nRevelation aside, one can only \"know\" Christ second-hand or worse.\n\nThis is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way\ninitially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible\nto interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where\nFaith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.\n\n\nNo. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple\nmoral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral\ncode. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child\nmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told\nthe child that it is \"wrong\". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in\nthe pub or bar (where there are no children). The \"wrongness\" here is if\nthe child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is \"inappropriate\"\nto swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of\nanimals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that\nhe is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but\nyou get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive\nas absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.\n\nDavid.\n\n---\nOn religion:", "label": 19}

Even though publicly they say that they support the Greek\ncause, practically they not only do nothing, but instead, using some usual\n\"reasoning\" and other crap rhetoric as a pretext, they gradually\nbackup Kemal (who had given now to the British \"water and bread\" that\nhe will dissolve the superethnic Ottoman and contract it into a small\nethnic-state). The main drive behind this British switch was the plan\nto keep a Muslim state in the region as buffer against a Russian expansion\ninto warm-water facilities.

A fundamentalist\nwould train their children in the way God proscribes, not in the way that\nman proscribes.

I think many\npeople use it to cover people who believe in inerrancy and a number of\nrelated concepts (e.g. denial of evolution).  While the original\nfundamentals movement was somewhat more specific, I would think most\npeople who accept inerrancy would actually support the whole original\nagenda.  (It included a list of key traditional doctrines, e.g.  the\nvirgin birth.)  The term is now being used by the press to describe\naggressive conservative religions in general, most typically those who\nare attempting to legislate religion.\n\nLegalism is yet another ill-defined term.  However there is some\nreason for its use in this context.  In fact the common theological\ndefinition is the believe that salvation is through the Law.  I hope\nno one here believes that our conservative contributors hold this\nview.  However there is a basic difference in approach over what we\nexpect to get out of the Bible.  The conservative approach expects to\nfind specific behavioral rules.  Generally the posters advocating this\napproach talk about the relevant passages from Paul's letter as God's\nLaw.  The liberal approach expects to find general principles, but it\nregards specific behavioral rules subject to change depending upon the\nculture and other things.  It's easy to see why a liberal would regard\nthe conservative approach as legalism.  It's hard to know quite what\nother term to use.  The issue in this case is not inerrancy, because\nno one is saying that Paul made a factual error.  Rather, the question\nis whether his statements are to be taken as Law.  Calling the\npositive answer legalism seems obvious enough terminology.  I haven't\nseen any good alternative.", "label": 15}

The Mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market, as in the U.S. A local magazine, Next Magazine (similar to Newsweek here), uses the Mac extensively. I have seen Sir Speedy and other franchises in Hong Kong equipped with Mac-based systems. True, the discount is not as steep as here because customers in Hong Kong cannot buy from gray market, nor are Mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like Apple does here with the Performa lin\n\n\ne. At this point the sale of Mac is handled by one exclusive distributor. On the other hand, you can always get a PC clone or in the earlier days, illegal clones of the Apple IIe.\n\nYour perception of the Mac not being too popular in Hong Kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell PC clones with probably illegal copies of BIOS than to pay for a Mac.\n\nSimilarly you cannot say Lotus 1-2-3 surely is not well accepted in Hong Kong because the sale is so low. May be it is because of all those places in Kowloon where illegal copies of Lotus 1-2-3 can be bought for $20 and $10 for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals.", "label": 4}

The course included\ncults and briefly mentioned/analyzed Jonestown.  (Did some external\nreading too).\n\nWilliam Adorno ... edited a series of books on the psychology of\n\"evil\" mass movements...  starting with THE AUTHORITARIAN PERSONALITY,\nUniversity of Chicago Press, 1948 ... an attempt to figure out what\nwould motivate people to support fascism or be the bad guys in WWII,\nand by extension in other wars, in racial lynchings ...  I don't think\nthe books are perfect, and the study of psychopathology has advanced\n..., but you can elicit Koresh types from even the first volume.  So I\nthink they're onto something.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\tHow cult psychology works...\n\t[I'm an amateur.  Hope I'm not hopelessly naive.]\n\nSo long as Koresh could \"own\" his people, he made sure they didn't\nbelieve there was any life out there for them, away from him.\nOtherwise, he'd (Koresh) be nothing.  During the siege, ex-Davidians\nrecounted how he convinced the people in the compound they survived\nonly through his intercession with God to spare their worthless souls.\nAbsolutely classic brainwashing technique. ...  As long as they\nbelieved him, they'd ignore BATF/FBI/Child Protective Services or even\nthe Red Cross asking them to come out.  After all, if they ever left\nhim, God would catapult them straight to Hell, and the combined forces\nof the US gummint, with all the goodwill in the world (doubtful)\ncouldn't save them for a second.  If I believed it, I'd stay and die\ntoo, like the folks in Jonestown.\n\nFor a prosaic analogy, replace a cult leader with an estranged wife\n(or husband), and notice how many folks show up, kill the ex and then\nthemselves.  That's the consequence of shattered \"cultism.\"  It really\ndoes happen all the time.  [By the way, the treasured ideal in such\ncases, without which life is meaningless, is the relationship, no\nmatter how abusive, rather than the individual's partner.]\n\n...\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n    [Why No News, Don't The Feds Owe The World An Explanation?]\n\nI agree that official explanations are in order.  I can also see good\n(?)  reasons for news blackouts.\n\n\n ... that no matter what, those people would have died, because Koresh\nmade sure they believed they had no lives outside his influence.\nHence it would make little difference when or how the FBI acted.  He\nheld them hostage, as his trump against going to jail, but nothing\nwould really stop him from offing them.  Even if the FBI went away!\n\nLook at history.  Rep Leo Ryan (and some staffers) visited Jonestown,\nat the request of constituents who had relatives there.  Once\nJonestown was discovered, and even though they killed Ryan and his\nentourage ... they all killed themselves, because Jim Jones knew he'd\nbe busted.  Internal arguments asking to spare the children, brought\nup by some of the women in the cult, were shouted down.  There are\ntapes...  The \"logic\" of saying that no matter how bad the gummint is, it\nwouldn't kill the kids, was shouted down as blasphemy, and the people\nwho brought it up were threatened with ostracism by people who by\nTHEIR OWN AVOWAL would be dead within the hour.  I suspect it's the\nsame with the Branch Davidians.\n(There's a book on Jonestown by James Reston Jr., titled OUR FATHER\nWHO ART IN HELL.  I don't know whether it's good - never read it.)\n\n...\nThe only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate\nreports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment, or organizations buying\nfull-auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via UPS, on the\noff chance of stumbling across cults that would kill themselves. ...\n\nSo, the only way the BATF/FBI could \"save\" those people, and future\ncults, is by ignoring such signs.\n\nI suppose there's another way - outsmarting Koresh and tricking him\ninto letting them go, or somehow influencing \"his\" people to abandon\nhim while he owns most of their means of communication with the world.\n... a mighty tough row to hoe. ...  I suspect the FBI tried to do that\nwith blackouts, noise and other sensory insults.  However, maybe\nthey're not very sophisticated, or maybe the job is impossible.  It's\ncertainly possible the guy running the show was a jerk.\n\n...\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t[Why the FBI might want to blackout during and coverup after]\n\n    ... - if they were doing a poor job of weaning the BD's from\nKoresh, they'd want to keep it quiet so they wouldn't be embarrassed.\n\n    ... - if they were trying to wean the BD's from Koresh, they'd\nwant to keep it quiet so he couldn't outflank them, or well-meaning\nboneheads from ANY point of view wouldn't screw it up. ...  I _hate_\nplaying chess when the world screams in my face, especially if at\ncheckmate time people really die, and I could be blamed.\n\n...\n\nI don't think ignoring such incidents is a workable policy, unless you\ndeny the FBI, BATF, Child Protective Services (of whatever stripe) and\nthe rest of the gummint should exist at all. \n\n\t\t(the end)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------", "label": 16}

The availability of them in the USA makes them the preferred  \n: murder weapon, but ban them, and some other weapon will step in as the  \n: favorite.\n\nAs a \"favorite\", sure.  As lethal, not likely.  A study of violence in\nChicago produced this table:\n\n\t\tPercentage of Reported Gun and Knife Attacks\n\t\t\t    Resulting in Death\n\t\t\t    \n\tWeapon\t\t\t\tDeaths As Percentage of Attacks\n\t---------------------------------------------------------------\n\tKnives (16,518 total attacks)\t\t 2.4\n\tGuns (6,350 total attacks)\t\t12.2\n\n\tSource: Firearms and Violence in American Life\n\t\nIt might be contended that if gun murderers were deprived of guns\nthat they would find a way to kill as often with knives.  If this were\nso, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide\nwould be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in\ncities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show\na higher fatality rate.  But the Nat'l Commission on the Causes and\nPrevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this\nnot to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife\nattacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks\n(which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants),\nthe proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the\nproportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.\n\nWhat was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on\nthe part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended\nto show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave\nphysical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the\nhead neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this\npattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of\nrage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.\n\n\tSource: Report on Firearms and Violence\n\n: Then, since England != USA (my ancestors left because of the oppression) you  \n: must compare England before strict gun laws to England after strict gun laws to  \n: be able to draw any meaning at all.  England has essentially legalized drugs,  \n: so there are no drug gangs battling for turf, etc., there.  If you drop out the  \n: drug related killings here, the USA would look a whole lot more peaceful.\n\nThere are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually, I'm not\nfond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and\nAmericans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic\ndifferences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found\nmyself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I\ndon't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent\ncrime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every\nlaw-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.\n\nOn the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more\nculturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive,\nseven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates\nof Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities\nwith roughly the same population, urban economy, geography\nand crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.\n\nIn Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After\na 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed\nweapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.\n\nIn Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason\nto purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted.\nRecreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are\nregulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a\nrestricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in\norder to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns\ntransported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box.\nIn short, gun control but not unreasonably so.\n\nBoth cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for\ngun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers\nstudied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated),\nburglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from\n1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same\nstandard: the FBI's Unified Crime Report.\n\nResults: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver\n(1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99).\n18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in\nVancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 /\n1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher\n(1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by\nweapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged.\nAlthough both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated\nassault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were\nfar more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.\n\nOver the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle\n(11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000).\nAfter adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations,\nthe relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as\ncompared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.\n\nWhen homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate\nof homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in\nSeattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver.\nVirtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to\na more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns\naccounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns\nwere 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than\nin Vancouver.\n\nThe authors of the report also investigated \"legally justifiable\"\nhomicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during\nthe seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only\n21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in\nSeattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After\nexcluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these\nearlier findings.\n\n-------\n\nThis is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the\nargument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because\nVancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times\nthat of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports\nannual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC,\nChicago, Los Angeles and Houston.\n\nCritics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access\nto handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because\npersons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a\ngun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently.\nIf the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by\nthe strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we\ncould expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to\nbe higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study\ninterval, Vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns\nwas not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that\nfew would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.\n\nAs well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding\ncitizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did\nexperience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these\ncases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities\nduring the course of the study period.  And, as was reported,\nSeattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime category\nover Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for\nself-defense.\n\n\tHeavily quoted source: Handgun Regulation, Crime,\n\tAssaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities.\n\n\tJohn H.

{"text": "\n     There are some issues which come to mind when one considers\nthe law enforcement aspects of the use of the Big Brother\n(Clipper) chip.\n     The drug dealers and terrorists aren't going to let\nthemselves be caught by using this type of encryption.  In 1985\nthe New York Times reported that government investigators broke\nup a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticated\nequipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring to\neavesdrop on the law-enforcement agents who were trying to arrest\nthem.\n     A Mr. Deely, an NSA official, said \"There are a lot of\nmedium-sized countries that would have been proud to have the\nsignals intelligence operation of this group.\"\n     For every John Gotti there are probably many more people who\nhave the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecure\ncommunications are.  The press given to the Big Brother chip will\nonly increase their numbers.\n     Even if there is some benefit to law-enforcement through the\nuse of Big Brother, it must be weighed against the constitutional\nand civil liberties questions involved.\n     For example, in some areas of the world torture is used as\nan investigative tool by the local \"law-enforcement\" people.  I\nsuspect it is an effective means of obtaining information and\nshortening many investigations.  It probably also helps keep the\nconviction rate high.\n     The fact that the torture tool is not used in this country\n(even with a court order obtained by showing \"probable cause\") is\nbecause we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency and\nwhat is ethically and morally right.\n     I think that the same question of expediency versus morality\nshould come into play when considering the use of Big Brother.  I\nvote for morality.\n     I am quite disturbed by what I interpret as a veiled threat\nto prohibit the use of all encryption if this Big Brother chip is\nnot put into wide spread use.  After a quick reading of the White\nHouse press release I came away with that impression.\n     To most of the American public, the word \"hacker\" has\nrightly or wrongly come to mean \"high tech adolescent vandal\".\nIt has struck me that most of the people posting to sci.crypt\nregarding this issue are intelligent, thoughtful individuals who\nhave genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issues\nsurrounding Big Brother.  I hope that the use of Big Brother does\nnot become mandatory and other encryption become illegal.  I\nwould hate to see this become some kind of high tech Volstead\nAct.\n     The high speed digital communications revolution is coming\nat us with the speed of an SST.  The times they are a changing,\nand just as IBM is learning that they can't do business the same\nway they have done it for the past 40 years, maybe NSA should\nevaluate another approach.\n     EFF, who have correctly questioned the cryptographic\nstrength of Big Brother, may need to send a stronger message out\nregarding the constitutional issues involved.\n     Al Gore may want to think this one through a little more.\n     And as for Dorothy Elizabeth Robling Denning: En quoi cela\nvous concerne, cheri?\n", "label": 11}

{"text": "This was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list.\n==============================================================\nHi Folks;\n\nWednesday marked day 2, the beginning of the trial.  Opening\nstatements were given by both the prosecution and the defense,\neach side presenting its version of what happenned last August.\n\nThe prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved to\nIdaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the \"evil\" federal\ngovernment.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federal\nagents \"sawed off\" shotguns and later failed to appear for\ntrial: Despite repeated \"good faith\" efforts to get Weaver\nto surrender peacefully, Weaver refused.  The shootout erupted\nwhen Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and\nbegan firing.  According to the prosecution, three people\nwere taking an \"offensive action\" against an FBI helicopter\nwhen an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver.\n\nThe defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northern\nIdaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wanted\nsimply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents to\nsell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecution\nalleged, want to become a \"regular supplier\").  The defense also\nargued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver when\nhe wouldn't become an informant [it is not specified explicitly,\nbut I assume that this is a reference to the white separatist\nangle of the story.  We'll know more as things develop].  The\nfailure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was given\nan incorrect court date and then indicted before that date.\nThe shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killed\nWeaver's dog that was in proximity to Weaver's son, Samuel.  Weaver\nthen fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle, federal\nagent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found,\nthere were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic:\nHowever, agents were near the body for an extended period of\ntime and could have played with the select-fire - this will\nhave to be more fully explained).  Finally, the defense claims\nthat Vicki Weaver was only going to \"look at the body\" [not recover?]\nof her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper.\n\nProsecution quote: \"Weaver wanted that confrontation, and he made\nthat confrontation.\" -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist\n\nDefense quote: \"The evidence in this case is going to show that\nthis is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged\nwith crimes they didn't commit in order to cover crimes that\nthe government did commit.\"  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!]\n\nNotes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supporters\nheeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday's protests\noutside the courthouse.  However, the local NBC affiliate\nagain had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including\n\"Tim\" again.  \"Tim\" claimed he was a skinhead, who were \"ordinary,\nworking class people.\"  He also claimed he was for \"white pride,\nnot white power.\"\n\nOutside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview\nwith Bo Gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly\nwhat the government wants to smear Randy Weaver.\n\nIn an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_, about\na dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the\ncourthouse.  These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spence\nin action, and to perhaps learn something from him.  Some\ntidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kent\nwere volunteering their time to represent Weaver because they\nbelieved in him.  Spence, during his 90-minute opening statement,\nrepeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on the\ndefendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during the\nrecounting of his wife's death), and Spence compared the \"sawed\noff\" shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (another\ngood one!).\n\nToday (Thursday, April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled to\nbegin presenting evidence.\n\nDrew\n=============================================================\n\n", "label": 16}

Because his messengership is\nuniversal, he has been distinguished by  miracles that\nrelate to almost all species of creation.\n    Just as the supreme aide of a renowned ruler, arriving\nwith many gifts in a city where various people live, will be\nwelcomed by a representative of each people who\nacclaims him and bids him welcome in his own language\nso, too, when the supreme messenger of the Monarch of\nPre- and  Post-Eternity  (Ezel and Ebed  Sultani) honored the\nuniverse by coming as an envoy to the inhabitants of the\nearth, and brought with him the light of truth and spiritual\ngifts sent by the Creator of the universe and derived from\nthe realities of the whole universe, each species of\ncreation -from water, rocks, trees, animals and human\nbeings to the moon, sun and stars- welcomed him and\nacclaimed his prophethood, each in its own language, and\neach bearing one of his miracles.\n    Now it would require a voluminous work to mention all\nhis miracles.  As the punctilious scholars have written\nmany volumes concerning the proofs of His prophethood,\nhere we will briefly point out only the general category\ninto which fall fhe miracles that are definite and accepted\nas accurate reports.\n    The evidences of the prophethood of Muhammad\n(SAW) fall into two main categories:  \n\n    The first is called irhasat and includes the paranormal \nevents that happened at the time of his birth, or before his \ndeclaration of prophethood.  \n\n    The second group pertains to all the remaining evidences \nof the prophethood, and contains two subdivisions: \n\n    1) Those wonders that were manifested after\nhis departure from this world in order to confirm his\nprophethood, and \n\t2) Those that he exhibited during the era\nof his prophethood.  The latter has also two parts:  \n\t2.1) The evidences of his prophethood that became manifest\nin his own personality, his inner and outer being, his moral\nconduct and perfection, and \n    2.2) The miracles that: related to substantial matters.  \nThe last part again has two branches:  \n\t2.2.1) Those concerning the Qur'an and spirituality, and \n\t2.2.2) Those relating to matter and creation.  This last \nbranch is again divided into two categories:  \n\t2.2.2.1) The first involves the paranormal happenings \nthat occured during his mission either to break the \nstubbornness of the unbelievers, or to augment the\nfaith of the belivers.  This category has twenty different\nsorts, such as the splitting of the moon, the flowing of\nwater from the fingers, the satisfying of large numbers with\na little food, and the speaking of trees, rocks and animals\nEach of these sons has also many instances, and thus\nhas, in meaning, the strength of confirmation by\nconsensus.  \n\t2.2.2.2)  As for the second category, this\nincludes events lying in the future that occured as he had\npredicted upon Allah (SWT)'s instructions.  Now starting\nfrom the last category, we will summarize a list of them.(1)\n\n(1) Unfonunately, I could not write as I had intended\nwithout choice, I wrote as my head dictated, and I could\nnot completely conform to the order of this classification.\n", "label": 19}

A week ago, I managed to find time to consult\na Septuagint Concordance and a LXX text with apparatus at the library,\nand I can now usefully conclude my look at the Greek words for love as\nused in the Christian background of the Septuagintal translation of the\nJewish scriptures.\n\nThe principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal\nnoun from _erao:_, _eraste:s_ meaning \"lover.\"  This cluster occurs just\nwhere one might most expect it, in the propethic image (and accusation)\nof Israel as faithless spouse to YHWH.  The verses in question are Hosea\n2:5,7 & 10; Jeremiah 4:30, 22:20 & 22; Lamentations 1:19; and Ezekiel\n16:33, 36 &37 and 23:5, 9 & 22.\n\n\t[ Hosea seems to have originated this usage, which Jeremiah and\n\t  Ezekiel picked up;  Lamentations is dependent on, though not\n\t  likely written by, Jeremiah. ]\n\nThe \"erotic\" meaning (in its allegorical use, not at all literally) is\nevident.  So too in English, unless you complement it with a phrase like\n\"of the arts\" the word \"lover\" is going to have an overtone of sexual\nrelationship.  There is no surprise here, but it is worthwhile to see\nthat standard Greek usage *does* show up in the translations from the\nHebrew! :-)\n\nMore interestingly, and some confirmation of my guess that later Koine\nusage avoided the verb _erao:_ because of its homonymy to _ero:_ (say),\n_eromai_ (ask), there is an error in Codex Vaticanus (normally, a very\nvaluable witness) where a form of _erao:_ is used in a completely absurd\ncontext -- 2 Samuel 20:18, where the  meaning *must* be \"say.\"\n\nIn addition to the above (and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs),\nEsther 2:17 uses the verb in its most natural application, \n\n\tkai e:rasthe\" ho basileus Esthe:r  --  and the King loved Esther\n\nand, rather more interestingly, 1 Samuel 19:2 supplies a modest degree of\nsupport to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan:\n\n\tkai Io:nathan huios Saoul e:[i]reito ton Dauid sphodra\n\t-- and Jonathan, Saul's son, loved David intensely\n\n\t[ I'm using the bracketed [i] for io:ta subscript, which I\n\t  don't yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for. ]\n\n(The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about\nthe \"historical\" facts, but just that a quasi-official translation of\nthe Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the\n\"erotic\" verb in this context.  Given the quite general usage of _agapao:_\nfor erotic senses, this need not mean anything \"more\" than _agapao:_ alone\nwould mean, but it DOES disambiguate the relationship, as far as this\ntranslator goes!)", "label": 15}

If you're feeling\ncreative, and your favorite number hasn't been taken already, you can\nmake a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non-\nbase-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not\nthat you won't get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)\n\nOh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You'll\njust be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole\nnet, and you'll look like a clueless newbie too.\n\nBy now you're probably asking \"So who's the KotL already?\". Well, as\nJohn Sloan notes below, that's about the only real \"secret\" left around\nhere, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself,\nnor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was\nthe original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the\nKotL's first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely\nwith hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line-\noriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting\nmessages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with \"weenie\nmailers\"). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a\nDead-Head.\n\n***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************\n\nOnce you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically\ngroveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed\nwork for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting\nsomething done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)\ndays, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of\neconomic activity on the part of the KotL's employers, sending yet\nanother copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it\njust makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an\nexcersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least\nannotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request\nwas submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think\nthe KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).\n\n***********************************************************************\n\nOne more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren't what\nthey used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya?\nThe typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, &\ne-mail address. For example:\n\n0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM\n\n(PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only\nrequirements for DoD membership, that's not strictly true these days, as\nthere are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.)\n\nBlaine (Dances With Bikers) Gardner   blgardne@javelin.sim.es.com\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n            \"Denizens of Doom\", by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161)\n\n      [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted with Bruce's permission]\n\nThere is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal \nthings that a bunch of bikers do.  They discuss motorcycles and  \nmotorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,  \nhelmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve\nseats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, \ntraffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double \nentendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They \nargue with each other and plan rides together.\n\nThe difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, \nalthough they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each \nother face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world \nand communicate with each other electronically via computer.\n\nThe computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;  \nthe people range from college and university students to high-tech industry \nprofessionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently, \nrec.motorcycles (pronounced \"wreck-dot-motorcycles,\" it's the file name for \nthe group's primary on-line \"meeting place\") carries about 2250 articles per \nmonth;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent \nposters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred \nto as the DoD.\n\nThe DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of \nparodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer \nenthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, \"Denizen \nof Doom.\"  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of \nthe Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of \ncourse, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.\n\nThe idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules \nappealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the \nList, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been \nalmost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and \nCanada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, \nGermany, Norway and Finland.\n\nKeeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run \nof 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the \nAmerican Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser -- \nselling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a \nfew months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were \ndonated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 \nto the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs \nin the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.\n\nAs often as possible, the DoD'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go \nriding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of \nDoD'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California's \n\"Silicon Valley.\"  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on \nRollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California \n\"Joust.\"\n\nThe Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big \nbarbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern \nCalifornia ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north, \nmeeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan \nfor 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction \nwith the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.\n\nThough it's a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective \ncommunications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional \nmotorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in \nsearch of two-wheeled camaraderie, it's a great way for kindred spirits to \nget together.  Long may they flame.\n\n\n\"Live to Flame -- Flame to Live\"\t[centerbar]\n\nThis official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which \nyou can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do \nanything like that face to face.  These insults are known as \"flames\";  \nissuing them is called \"flaming.\"  Flames often start when a member \ndisagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A \ntypical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be \nsomething like:  \"What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad \nposeur!\"  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense \nof the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding \nability and your cat.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_\n\n                  by John Sloan  DoD #0011\n\nPeriodically the question \"What is DoD?\" is raised. This is one of\nthose questions in the same class as \"Why is the sky blue?\", \"If there\nis a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?\" and \"Why do\nwomen inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before they\ndump you?\", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,\nand philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion\nby philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the\nhalls of academe for generations. \n\nA long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few\nminutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on\na computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two\nmachines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another\nvia a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but\nwho was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of\nthe various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and\nsigned it \"The Denizen of Doom\". Not wishing to identify himself, he\nasked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time\nbecome DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit\nabout what other people thought and generally being a right thinking\nindividual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed. \n\nHe who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was\nthe funniest thing he'd seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty\neasily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom\nMotorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership\nnumber. \n\nPerhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a\nmotorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or\nmake or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized\nelectronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a\npart of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a\ngestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the\nsum of its parts.  It could also be that we're all computer nerds who\nwear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen\nto also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight\nratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open\nminded enough to accept us as members. \n\nIn a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom\nMotorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have\nnever met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet\nfeel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some\nof the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized\nand run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the\nnetwork via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list\n(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the\nsame region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating\naround the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by\n#11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and\ndistributed on VHS by #18)! \n\nWhere will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races,\nplacing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine\nmanagement computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each\nparticipant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?\nWill the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal\nroom and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell. \n\nThe DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net\naccess and a love for motorcycles. To become a member, one need only\nask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few\nreally good club secrets). New members will receive via email a\nmembership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which\nincludes name, state, and email address. \n\nThe Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever (or at least\nuntil next year when we may decided to change the name). \n\n                  Live to Flame - Flame to Live\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     The DoD daemon as seen on the patches, pins, etc. by\n\n\tChuck Rogers,  car377@druhi.att.com,  DoD #0003\n \n\n                :-(           DoD            )-: \n               :-(  x    __         __    x   )-:      \n              :-(  x    / /         \\ \\    x   )-:     \n             :-(  x    / / -\\-----/- \\ \\    x   )-:    \n            :-(  L     | \\/  \\   /  \\/ |     F   )-:   \n            :-(  I     | /    \\ /    \\ |     L   )-:   \n            :-(  V     \\/ __   /   __ \\/     A   )-:   \n            :-(  E     / /  \\     /  \\ \\     M   )-:   \n            :-(        | |   \\   /   | |     E   )-:   \n            :-(  T     | | . | _ | . | |         )-:   \n            :-(  O     | \\___// \\\\___/ |     T   )-:   \n            :-(         \\     \\_/     /      O   )-:   \n            :-(  F       \\___     ___/           )-:   \n            :-(  L        \\ \\     / /        L   )-:   \n            :-(  A         \\ vvvvv /         I   )-:   \n            :-(  M         | (   ) |         V   )-:   \n            :-(  E         | ^^^^^ |         E   )-:   \n             :-(  x        \\_______/        x   )-:    \n              :-(  x                       x   )-:     \n               :-(  x   rec.motorcycles   x   )-:\n                :-(          USENET          )-:\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                      The DoD\n\n              by the Denizen of Doom    DoD #1\n \nWelcome one and all to the flamingest, most wonderfullest newsgroup of\nall time: wreck.mudder-disciples or is it reak.mudder-disciples?

It's just your guilt complex working against\nyou. Read 'em and weep. \n\nWe tune in on a conversation between some of our heros. Terrible\nBarbarian is extolling the virtues of his Hopalonga Puff-a-cane to\nReverend Muck Mudgers and Stompin Fueling-Injection: \n\nTerrible: This Hopalonga is the greatest... Beats BMWs dead!! \n\nMuck: I don't mean to preach, Terrible, but lighten up on the BMW\n     crowd eh?  I mean like I like riding my Yuka-yuka Fudgeo-Jammer\n     11 but what the heck.  \n\nStompin: No way, the BMW is it, complete, that's all man.\n\nTerrible: Nahhhh, you're sounding like Heritick Ratatnack! Hey, at\n     least he is selling his BMW and uses a Hopalonga Intercorruptor!\n     Not as good as a Puff-a-cane, should have been called a\n     Woosh-a-stream.\n\nStompin: You mean Wee-Stream.\n\nTerrible: Waddya going to do? Call in reinforcements???\n\nStompin: Yehh man. Here comes Arlow Scarecrow and High Tech. Let's see\n     what they say, eh? \n\nMuck: Now men, let's try to be civil about this.\n\nHigh Tech: Hi, I'm a 9 and the BMW is the greatest.\n\nArlow: Other than my B.T. I love my BMW!\n\nTerrible: B.T.???\n\nArlow: Burley Thumpison, the greatest all American ride you can own.\n\nMuck: Ahhh, look, you're making Terrible gag.\n\nTerrible: What does BMW stand for anyway??? \n\nMuck, Arlow, High: Beats Me, Wilhelm.\n\nTerrible: Actually, my name is Terrible. Hmmm, I don't know either.\n\nMuck: Say, here comes Chunky Bear.\n\nChunky: Hey, Hey, Hey! Smarter than your average bear!\n\nTerrible: Hey, didn't you drop your BMW???\n\nChunky: All right eh, a little BooBoo, but I left him behind. I mean \n     even Villy Ogle flamed me for that! \n\nMuck: It's okay, we all makes mistakes.\n\nOut of the blue the West coasters arrive, led by Tread Orange with\nDill Snorkssy, Heritick Ratatnack, Buck Garnish, Snob Rasseller and\nthe perenial favorite: Hooter Boobin Brush! \n\nHeritick: Heya Terrible, how's yer front to back bias?\n\nTerrible: Not bad, sold yer BMW?\n\nHeritick: Nahhh.\n\nHooter: Hoot, Hoot.\n\nBuck: Nice tree Hooter, how'd ya get up there?\n\nHooter: Carbujectors from Hell!!!\n\nMuck: What's a carbujector?\n\nHooter: Well, it ain't made of alumican!!! Made by Tilloslert!!\n\nMuck: Ahh, come on down, we aren't going to flame ya, honest!!\n\nDill: Well, where do we race?\n\nSnob: You know, Chunky, we know about about your drop and well, don't\n     ride! \n\nMuck: No! No! Quiet!\n\nTread: BMW's are the greatest in my supreme level headed opinion.\n     They even have luggage made by Sourkraut!\n\nHigh: My 9 too!\n\nTerrible, Heritick, Dill, Buck: Nahhhhh!!!\n\nStompin, Tread, High, Chunky, Snob: Yesss Yessssss!!!\n\nBefore this issue could be resolved the Hopalonga crew called up more\ncohorts from the local area including Polyanna Stirrup and the\ninfamous Booster Robiksen on his Cavortin! \n\nPolyanna: Well, men, the real bikers use stirrups on their bikes like\n     I use on my Hopalonga Evening-Bird Special. Helpful for getting\n     it up on the ole ventral stand!  \n\nTerrible: Hopalonga's are great like Polyanna says and Yuka-Yuka's and\n     Sumarikis and Kersnapis are good too! \n\nBooster: I hate Cavortin.\n\nAll: WE KNOW, WE KNOW.\n\nBooster: I love Cavortin.\n\nAll: WE KNOW WE KNOW.\n\nMuck: Well, what about Mucho Guzlers and Lepurras?\n\nSnob, Tread: Nawwwwww.\n\nMuck: What about a Tridump?\n\nTerrible: Isn't that a chewing gum?\n\nMuck: Auggggg, Waddda about a Pluck-a-kity?\n\nHeritick: Heyya Muck, you tryin' to call up the demon rider himself?\n\nMuck: No, no. There is more to Mudder-Disciples than arguing about make.\n\nTwo more riders zoom in, in the form of Pill Turret and Phalanx Lifter.\nPill: Out with dorsal stands and ventral stands forever.\n\nPhalanx: Hey, I don't know about that.\n\nAnd Now even more west coasters pour in.\nRoad O'Noblin: Hopalonga's are the greatest!\n\nMaulled Beerstein: May you sit on a bikejector!\n\nSuddenly more people arrived from the great dark nurth:\nKite Lanolin: Hey, BMW's are great, men.\n\nRobo-Nickie: I prefer motorcycle to robot transformers, personally.\n\nMore riders from the west coast come into the discussion:\nAviator Sourgas: Get a Burley-Thumpison with a belted-rigged frame.\n\nGuess Gasket: Go with a BMW or Burley-Thumpison.\n\nWith a roar and a screech the latest mudder-disciple thundered in. It\nwas none other that Clean Bikata on her Hopalonga CaBammerXorn. \nClean: Like look, Hopalonga are it but only CaBammerXorns. \n\nMuck: Why??\n\nClean: Well, like it's gotta be a 6-banger or nothin.\n\nMuck: But I only have a 4-banger.\n\nClean: No GOOD!\n\nChunky: Sob, some of us only have 2-bangers!\n\nClean: Inferior!\n\nStompin: Hey, look, here's proof BMW's are better. The Bimmer-Boys\nburst into song: (singing) Beemer Babe, Beemer Babe give me a\nthrill... \n\nRoad, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Wadddoes BMW stand for? \n\nHeritick, Stompin, Snob, Chunky, Tread, Kite, High, Arlow: BEAT'S ME,\n     WILHEM! \n\nRoad, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Oh, don't you mean BMW? \n\nAnd so the ensuing argument goes until the skies clouded over and the\nthunder roared and the Greatest Mudder-Disciple (G.M.D.) of them all\nboomed out.\nG.M.D.: Enough of your bickering! You are doomed to riding\n     Bigot & Suction powered mini-trikes for your childish actions. \n\nAll: no, No, NO!!! Puhlease.\n\nDoes this mean that all of the wreck.mudder-disciples will be riding\nmini-trikes?  Are our arguing heros doomed?  Tune in next week for the\nnext gut wretching episode of \"The Yearning and Riderless\" with its\never increasing cast of characters.  Where all technical problems will\nbe flamed over until well done.  Next week's episode will answer the\nquestion of: \"To Helmet or Not to Helmet\" will be aired, this is heady\nmaterial and viewer discretion is advised. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Script for the Denizens of Doom Anthem Video\n\n                by Jonathan E.

I guess you had to be there. I\nwasn't.) \n\nChuck:  I didn't want to be a Software Systems Analyst,\n cow-towing to the whims of a machine, and saying yessir, nosir,\n may-I-have-another-sir.  My mother made me do it.  I wanted\n to live a man's life,\n[Music slowly builds in background]\n riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes\n and the deepest valleys,\n living the life of a Motorcyclist;\n doing donuts and evading the police;\n terrorizing old ladies and raping small children;\n eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner).  In short,\n\n\tI Want to be      A Denizen!\n\n[Chuck rips off his lab coat, revealing black leather jacket (with\nfringe), boots, and cap.

And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.\n\nSometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: \"What does DoD\nstand for? It's not the Department of Defense is it?\" Naturally, a\nDenizen who had watched the movie \"Top Gun\" a few times too many rose\nto the occasion and replied:\n\n\"That's classified, we could tell you, but then we'd have to kill you.\"\n\nAnd the rest is history.\n\nA variation on the \"security\" theme is to supply disinformation about\nwhat DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where\nknown) include:\n\nDaughters of Democracy (DoD 23)\t\tDoers of Donuts\nDancers of Despair (DoD 9)\t\tDebasers of Daughters\nDickweeds of Denver\t\t\tDriveway of Death\nDebauchers of Donuts\t\t\tDumpers of Dirtbikes\n\nNote that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be\nlimited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary file.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                     The rec.moto.photo archive\n\nFirst a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck\nRogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made,\nand several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in\nunknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate\nfor an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not\nonly provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken\nthe time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.\n\nNot only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk\nat their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the\nserver too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages,\nthe general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.\n\nHere are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how\nto use the archive.\n\n**********************************************************\n\nVia ftp:\n\ncerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]\n\nVia e-mail:\n\nThe address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the\nmessage.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  The\narguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For\nrec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:\n\ndir [dod]\nsend [dod]bruce_tanner.gif\nsend [dod]dodframe.ps\n\nand you'll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts\nof bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.\n\nOh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to\nthe next whole file) are send.  A 'send [dod]*.gif' would send 150 files of\n50K each; not a good idea.\n-- \nBruce Tanner        (213) 860-2451 x 596    Tanner@Cerritos.EDU\nCerritos College    Norwalk, CA             cerritos!tanner\n\n**********************************************************\n\nA couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so\nwhy not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful?\nSecond, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind\nof you to access it after normal working hours (California time). \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                      Patches? What patches?\n\nYou may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches &\npins. And your reaction was probably: \"I want!\", or \"That's sick!\", or\nperhaps \"That's sick! I want!\"\n\nWell, there's some good news and some bad news. The good news is that\nthere's been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad\nnews is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn't\nbecause of any \"exclusivity\" attempt, but simply because there is no\n\"DoD store\" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by\nindividual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is\nsomeone says \"I'm thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they'll cost\n$xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?\" Then\norders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the\npre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a\nDoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or\nproduce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all\nthis is anarchy in action.\n\nHere's a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and\nperpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99),\nmotorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts\n(DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and\npatches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by\npopular demand].\n\nAll \"profits\" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association\nMotorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been\ncontributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum,\nyou'll see a large plaque on the Founders' Wall in the name of \"Denizens\nof Doom, USENET, The World\", complete with a DoD pin.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere's a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.\n\n~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles\n~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>\n~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum\n~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT\n\nI received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum,\nthe other day.\n\n\"Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:\n\nCongratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the\nDenizens of Doom!  With your recent donation, the total amount donated is\nnow $5,500.  On behalf of the AMHF, please extend my heartfeld gratitude\nto all the membership of the Denizens.  The club's new plaque is presently\nbeing prepared.  Of course, everyone is invited to come to the museum to \nsee the plaque that will be installed in our Founders Foyer.  By the way,\nI will personally mount a Denizens club pin on the plaque.  Again, thank \nyou for all your support, which means so much to the foundation, the\nmuseum, and the fulfillment of its goals.\n\n                                Sincerely,\n\n\n                                Jim Rogers, D.O.D. #0395\n                                Director\n\nP.S.

Rides:\n\nSummer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third\nyear, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass\ntrip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got\ntogether for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north\nas NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of\nNorth Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great\nPacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse for\nriding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have\ncome to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]\n\nAlso worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the\nMoab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up,\nriding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal\n2-strokes.  And though it's not an \"official\" (as if anything could be\nofficial with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races\nin Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters\nto gather.  There's also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah.\nEuropean Denizens have staged some gathers too.

{"text": "-*----\n\nFar from being \"tossed out,\" the gospels are taken, almost\nuniversally, as the primary source of information about Jesus.\nI am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring.  Who \"tosses out\"\nthe New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this,\nbut the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb\nascribes this more broadly.\n\nPerhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is\nwhy, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far\noutnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels\n*not* taken as \"gospel truth\" that faithfully records just what\nhappened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, and\nthe answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken\nthis way by a critical reader.\n\nThere is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text,\nmeasures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the\ntext as \"historically valid\" or \"tosses out\" the text.  I suspect\nthis myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and\nsecondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority,\nand from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present\nhistorical arguments along these lines for their religious\nprogram.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary\nschool history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better\nsuch texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed\nabove, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if\nit bit him on the keister twice.\n\nLet me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts\nand their use in studying history.  First, all texts are\nhistorically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I\nhave never seen a notion of \"historical validity\" that makes any\nsense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as\ntelling the \"gospel truth\" about historical events, in the way\nthat many students are wont to read history texts in primary and\nsecondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite\nauthor's history of whatever.)\n\nEvery text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some\nperson (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every\ntext can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can\nwe learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does\nthe text provide evidence?\n\nThe diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of\nOregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical\nevidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the \nvampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The\nmodern American history textbooks that whitewash \"great American\nfigures\" are historical evidence.  These are all historical\nevidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all\nthat the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that\nJesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that \"great\nAmerican figures\" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school.\nThey are better evidence that some people \"saw\" the Maharishi,\nlate of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians\nthought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe\n\"saw\" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an\neducational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather\nthan teach history.\n\nHow does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of\nhistorical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a\nvery complex question that has no easily summarized answer.\nThere are many books on the subject or various parts of the\nsubject.  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer's \"Historian's Fallacies\"\nas a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy\nto read texts present history.  It's relatively cheap.  It's easy\nto read.  Give it a try.", "label": 19}

{"text": "\n\nThere is a fine line between \"getting players' input\" and \"knuckling\nunder to players' demands.\"  A manager, much like a military officer,\nneeds to have his (her) players' complete obedience and respect during\na game.  After the game, it's no big deal, but when there is no time \nto do more than react, players must trust the manager or the team often\nfalls apart (see: Boston Red Sox, ff. :) )  \n\nStrawberry's demeanor as represented by the media, often sounds like\ndemands.  I suspect that a comment like \"I enjoy hitting fourth; I'm\nused to it\" would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media if\nit came from Strawberry.  Russ Porter quoted Strawberry as saying,\n\"I feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and I think I perform best\nin that role.\"  (Paraphrased by my memory and bias.)  That seems like\na fairly non-petulant answer to what was almost certainly a question \nlike, \"How do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order?\"\nA more media-sensitive player might answer \"The manager knows what he is\ndoing.  If he thinks that batting me third will help the team, then I\nam all for it.\"  We'd ignore that answer as brown stuff, so it seems a\nlittle bit of an overreaction to brand Darryl's response as petulant.\n\nPersonally, I think his argument is nonsense and that it really doesn't\nmatter much in which order the #2-5 players in the order are batted,\nexcept for personal stats.  If I were Darryl, I'd probably answer that\nquestion, \"The number four spot gets a few more RBI opportunities and I get\npaid for RBIs.  I think it is best for me to bat fourth, but I am willing\nto hit third if Tommy thinks it will benefit the team.\"  or something like\nthat.  It would be helpful at salary time--my RBIs were down because I was\nhitting third--and make him sound like a \"team\" player.  Since Strawberry\nwill not likely go through arbitration, but use the free agent market for\nhis next contract, maybe that argument is useless, but it would help   \nhis image with the media without appearing to be totally content-free.", "label": 9}

I get a little queasy around the phrase \"aren't morally \nresponsible\", perhaps because I've heard it misused so many times.\n(I remember in college some folk trying to argue that a person who\nwas drunk was not morally responsible for his actions.) In general,\nmost folk can't control their dreams, but perhaps what you do all day\nand think about has some impact on them, hm? And I'm not sure what\n\"actions\" are in a dream. But I will note that Jesus does seem adamant\nabout the fact that our thought-life is at least as important as\nour actions. Go lightly with this argument - we are all morally\nresponsible for *who we are* and dreams might well be an important\npart of that.\n\nI don't know a thing about Out Of Body Experiences. I've had dreams, some\nfairly vivid ones; is an OOBE just a very vivid dream?

I'll note that the Bible\ndoesn't talk much about dreams outside of the realm of God using them to speak\nto us, with the caveat that such messages are not always very clear, as it\nwarns somewhere in the OT.

{"text": "\nI'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.\n\nEarly in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on\nhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I\nactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.\n\nI proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and\nrode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to\ninvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then\nI also passed my road test.\n\nOn May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a\n4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),\nI had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,\nskidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the\noncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was\nalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under\na car and been killed.\n\nNow this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the\nExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training\ncould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater\nsince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff\nas I did.\n\nSo my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I\nwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you\nhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until\nyou're ready to use it.\n\n\nWhile you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in\nDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you\nsave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,\nplus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure\nthe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up\nmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration\nand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not\nincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.\n\n\nI pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200\nin Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial\ncoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be\npoor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo\nmore expensive.\n\n\nThere used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle\nmagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or\nrecent models might be available.  You could probably look through\npast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first\nbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice\ninstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that\nare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by\nnoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around\nand they were generally set up the way I wanted.\n\nNothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting\nshowrooms.

In fact, the fillibuster we're talking about isn't\n*in* the Constitution.  I objected to your suggestion that the Senate\nwasn't intended to exercise the power it was clearly given.\n\n\n       I'll point out again that Reagan only had a Republican Majority\nin the Senate during his first term, and his coalition in the House\ncame apart at about the same time.  Bush never had any real support in\nCongress.\n\n       The real point is that everybody, *everywhere* got their pork,\nfrom the big corporations to the guy I saw last night leaving a\nconvenience store with an armful of junk-food he'd bought with\nfood stamps.  (He spent more in food stamps on junk than I *make* in a week\nand I'm not on government assitance.)\n\n\n       Lessee, let's pull out the old Almanac.\n\n       In 1980, total U.S. government budget outlays were 590.9 billion\ndollars.  In 1992 (est) they were 1.4754 trillion dollars, an increase of\napprox. 884 billion dollars.\n\n       In 1980, National Defense cost 133.9 billion dollars.  In\n192 it was 307 billion dollars, and increase of 174 billion dollars.\nThat leaves an increase of 710 billion dollars unaccounted\nfor.  (This represented an increase of 230%)\n\n       In 1980, Income Security (which includes retirement programs,\nHousing Assitance, and unemployment benefits, and I believe welfare)\ncost 86.5 billion dollars.  In 1992 it was 198 billion dollars, or\nmore than national defense started.  (This represented an increase\nof 230%)\n\n       In 1980, the Federal Government spent 32 billion dollars on\nMedicare.  In 1992 they spent 118 billion dollars.  (an increase of\n368%)\n\n       In 1980, the Feds spent 9 billion dollars on housing\ncredits and subsidies of that like.  In 1992 it was 87 billion.\n\n       In 1980, Health care services and research was 23 billion\ndollars.  In 1992, it was 94 billion dollars.\n\n       Agriculture, up 9 billion to 17 billion.\n\n       Science, up 11 billion to 16 billion.\n\n       Resource conservation up 7 billion to 20 billion.\n\n       Education up 14 billion to 45 billion.\n\n       Veteran benefits up 12 billion to 33 billion.\n\n       Trasnportation up 13 billion to 34 billion.\n     \n       About the only things I see which was seriously decreased was under \nthe Energy category, primarily under \"Supply,\" and \"Community Development,\"\nin the area of \"disaster relief,\" and between the two of them\nrepresent a loss of less than 11 billion dollars.\n\n       Where *was* this huge diversion?\n\n\n       Not that's a stretch.  If the current government was pushed by\nthe President to create this mess, wouldn't one expect it to begin to\nequalize once the pressure is gone?\n\n\n       Only assuming that the new role is a positive role we want\nto continue. I see very little positive about it.\n\n\n       The Constitution was *designed* to frustrate the democratic\nprocess, so that the voters could be absolutely sure they were getting\nwhat they wanted by the time it happened.  Nor do I see putting the\nbrakes on the \"democratic process\" an inherently bad thing.  Califronia's\nriding the edge and every time they pull their ballot initiative nonsense\nit gets worse.\n\n\n       Sometimes, or perhaps most of the time, the people should be\ntold, \"no,\" and pointed to their local government.       \n\n\n       Phill, would you do me the very great favor of repeating that\nin talk.politics.guns?\n\n\n       Cute.  We can eliminate violations of the law by eliminating\nthe law.\n\n\n       Free speech alone is dangerous, Phill.\n\n\n       OK, Phill.  All you gotta show me is a clear pattern of\n*reduction* in homicide rates across several countries and that'll\nbe it.  (Not current, mind, you, reduction.)\n\n\n\n        Who's chaining anything to freedom of speech?  By *calling*\nit a freedom?  \n\n\n       Phill, you're a master of subtly changing the subject.  I haven't\n*based* my argument against raw democracy on the Constitution.  I've\ntried to explain why it isn't a good idea.  The only time I've referred\nto the Constitution is to point out it doesn't contain the restrictions\non the veto and the Senate you appear to believe were \"meant,\" but\njust didn't make it in there.\n     \n       The Constitution doesn't *contain* the 41% fillibuster rule.\nI only believe that the rule is a good idea.

{"text": "LISTOWNER: I have sent this to Mr Anderson privately. Post it only\nif you think it of general interest.\n\nHere is a copy of something I wrote for another list. You may\nfind it relevant.\n\nA listmember asks:\n\n > What makes common-law marriages wrong?\n\nA common-law marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself. There is\nnothing in the Bible (Old or New Testament) about getting married by\na preacher, or by a priest (Jewish or Christian). And in fact Jewish\npriests have never had any connection with weddings.\n\nThere is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the\nclergyman. In fact, the traditional Christian view (at least in the\nWest) is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage,\nand that the clergyman is there only as a witness.\n\nHOWEVER!\n\nThe essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment. Two\npersons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound\nthemselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife,\nforsaking all others, till death do them part.\n\n      The reason why those who have reason to be concerned about who\nis married to whom have always insisted on some kind of public\nceremony is in order that society, and the couple themselves, may be\nclear about whether a commitment has been made.\n\nSuppose that we do away with the public ceremony, the standard vows,\netc. Instead, we have a man and a woman settling down to live\ntogether.\n      After a year or so, the man says to the woman: Hey, honey, it\nwas great while it lasted, but I think it's time to move on.\nyounger.\nocean, as eternal as the stars. As long as I live, I am yours,\nutterly and completely. When I lie on my deathbed, my last feeble\nbreath will utter your name. My...\"\nman is in a romantic mood, he is bound to say all kinds of silly\nthings like that. You mustn't take them literally.\n\nAnd that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that is\na matter of public record.\n      The Church insists on it, because it is her duty (among other\nthings) to give moral advice, and you cannot give a man moral advice\nabout his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is married\nto whom, if anybody, and vice versa.\n      The State insists on it, since the state has a concern with\nproperty rights, with child care and support, and therefore needs to\nknow who has made what commitments to whom.\n      Prospective fathers-in-law insist on it, because they don't\nwant their daughters seduced and abandoned.\n      Prospective spouses insist on it, because they want to make\nsure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment,\nor just \"poetry.\"\n      And persons making vows themselves insist on making them\nformally and publicly, in order that they may be clear in their own\nminds about what it is that they are doing, and may know themselves\nthat this is not just rhetoric. This is the real thing.\n\n      Hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of the\nmarriage commitment.  The Church goes further and insists that, when\nChristians marry, a clergyman shall be present at the wedding and\nrecord the vows on behalf of the Church, not because it is\nimpossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman, but in order\nto make sure that the couple understand what the Christian teaching\nabout marriage is, and that they are in fact promising to be married\nin a Christian sense. The Church also prefers a standard marriage\nvow, and is wary of letting couples Write their own vows, for much\nthe same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they\ndraw up a will or a contract. Certain language has been repeatedly\nused in wills, and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it.\nTry to say the same thing in your own words, and you may find that\nthe probate judge's interpretation of them is not at all what you\nintended.  Similarly, the Church prefers to avoid endless debates\nabout whether \"You are my main squeeze\" and \"I am here for the long\nhaul\" do in fact cover the same territory as \"forsaking all others\"\nand \"till death do us part.\"\n\n      This topic has come up on the list before. (Is there any topic\nthat hasn't?) One listmember was asking, \"If a couple love each\nother and are living together, isn't that marriage in the eyes of\nGod?\" Eventually someone asked, \"In that case, what is their status\nif they break up? Is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce?\nAre they in a relationship that God forbids either of them to walk\nof that!\" In fact, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that\nsomeone who says, \"We don't need a piece of paper or a ceremony in\nfront of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each\nother,\" is trying to have it both ways -- to have the advantages of\nmarriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum of\nbother.\n\nAt this point someone may say, \"None of this applies to me and my\nmate. We are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelong\ncommitment, 'for better or worse, forsaking all others, till death\nus do part.' So in our case, no ceremony is needed.\"\n     To this my reply would be: The reason for requiring a driver's\nlicense is to keep dangerous drivers off the road.  What is wrong in\nitself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers, but the existence\nof dangerous drivers. However, testing and licensing drivers is an\nobvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing the\nnumber of dangerous drivers on the road. Therefore the State rightly\nmakes and enforces such laws, and you the citizen have a positive\nmoral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matter\nhow much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you are.\n\nBack to the original question. We have a listmember who knows a\ncouple who have been living together for around 20 years. He asks:\nAt what point did they stop fornicating and start being married? I\nanswer: at the point, if any, where they both definitely and\nexplicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other, for\nbetter or worse, as long as they both lived. If they have accepted\nsuch an obligation, what are their reasons for not being willing to\ndeclare it in front of, say, a justice of the peace?", "label": 15}

{"text": "\n\nPardon me? Your ignorance cramps my conversation. Although the administrative \nmechanism was a strictly centralized one, the Ottoman Empire 'was a classical \nexample of a pluralist social order.' The 'millet system' was the mechanism \nwhich shaped the social order of the multi-national Ottoman Empire and stood \nbehind its continuity. As a matter of fact, because Islamic principles \nwere in force in the Ottoman Empire, it was natural to use religious \ncriteria to differentiate among the various communities which constituted \nthe Empire. The 'millet' system began to be based on ethnicity in the \n19th century under the influence of nationalism. Sousa writes of the \nexistence of thirteen communities in the Ottoman Empire in addition to \nthe Muslim 'millet' in 1914. These were: (1) Greeks attached to the \nOrthodox Patriarchate in Istanbul; (2) Catholics or Latins who were \nremnants of Genoese and Venetian merchants; (3) Gregorian Armenians \nattached to a Patriarchate in Istanbul; (4) Catholic Armenians; (5) Syrian \nCatholics attached to a Patriarchate in Mardin; (6) Chaldean Catholics \nattached to a Patriarchate in Mosul; (7) Syrian Jacobites attached to a \nPatriarchate in Mardin; (8) Protestants; (9) Melchites attached to a \nPatriarchate in Damascus; (10) Hebrews of two rites; (11) Bulgarian \nCatholics attached to the Bulgarian Exarch; (12) Maronites; and (13) \nNestorians.[1] Scholars who studied the pluralistic social structure \noutlined briefly above, concluded that the social order of the Ottoman \nEmpire fit the framework of the 'Mosaics Theory.'[2] \n\n[1] N.

{"text": "The last time we discussed homosexuality, I asked whether anyone could\nidentify any other act besides homosexual intercourse that the Bible\nprohibited, but which might in some circumstances bring no apparent\nharm to anyone. Put another way, the question is whether homosexual\nintercourse is the only act that Christians are supposed to believe\nis immoral solely on the basis that God says it is, with no insight\nbeing offered as to *why* it is immoral. No one could answer my\nquestion in either form from the Bible. (I did get an interesting\nresponse based on Roman Catholic theology).\n\nHowever, I think now that I can at least answer my first question.\nLink Hudson pointed me to it in his recent comments about sleeping\nwith one's aunt. Incest is held to be immoral in every society,\nthat is, there are some degrees of relationship where marriage\n(and thus, intercouse) is prohibited. The Bible is no exception.\nThe trouble is that it may be difficult to see *why* a particular\nrelationship qualifies as incestuous. Societies differ as to\nhow they define incest. Genetic reasons are sometimes offered, but\nall the Biblical cases cannot be dealt with that way. Why can't\na man sleep with his step mother--assuming that his father is\ndead and that he has \"married\" her? How does this case differ\nfrom the *duty* to marry one's brother's childless wife.\n\nAre these two cases parallel? Does the Bible prohibit some incestuous\nmarriages and homosexual marriages for the same reason, perhaps\nthat God knows they are not good for us and yet we are incapable\nof understanding why.\n\nP.S. Please don't bother writing me to tell me that I am a homophobe,\nas some did last time. My mind is not made up on these questions.\nYou don't know whether I am homophobic or not. You don't\nknow me.

EDT\n\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Please be seated.  I \nwant to say, first, how delighted I am to be here with Secretary \nRiley and with Senator Graham.  The three of us served as governors \ntogether during the 1980s when we worked constantly on strategies to \nimprove our schools, when we led often difficult and long efforts to \nupgrade the standards in American education and to improve the \nquality of instruction our children were receiving.  \n\t     \n\t     There were no two governors whom I admired more during \nthat period than the two who now stand on this stage with the Teacher \nof the Year.  And I think both of them would join me in saying that, \nafter all the testimony has been heard and all the bills have been \npassed and the funds have been raised and allocated, it all comes \ndown to what happens between the teacher and the students in the \nclassroom.\n\t     \n\t     That's why today's ceremony honoring the National \nTeacher of the Year is so important.  Tracey Leon Bailey is one \nrecognition all across our country for highly advanced and innovative \nscience programs.  He's developed and introduced into Florida's \nclassrooms cutting-edge programs in molecular biology and DNA \nfingerprinting -- subjects usually taught only in college and, I \nmight add, probably only dimly understood here in the Nation's \nCapital.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Within three years of being hired by a satellite high \nschool, Mr. Bailey's institution had one of the strongest science \nprograms in the entire state of Florida, and it won numerous national \nand international awards.  These advanced programs aren't just for a \nfavored few.  Tracey Bailey has inspired all kinds of students, \nincluding those previously known as low-achieving or at-risk to reach \nfor excellence and to attain it.  This is what our students need and \nwhat our country needs. \n\t     \n\t     Today, we know that a good future with high wages and \nrich opportunities rests on the foundation of quality education for a \nlifetime.  The basics aren't enough anymore.  All our kids need \ncompetence in math and science and advanced problem-solving.  That's \nwhy Tracey Bailey's accomplishments are so important and why I am so \npleased and proud to participate in recognizing and honoring these \naccomplishments. \n\t     \n\t     Tracey, you represent the best in the United States.  \nI'm glad to recognize you today and to formally present you with this \nApple Award as the Teacher of the Year for 1993.  (Applause.)  \n\t     \n\t     MR. BAILEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.  It is indeed a \ngreat honor and a tremendous responsibility to represent the nation's \n2.5 million teachers.  And we appreciate the support that you have \nshown for education, and we're looking forward to working with you to \nhelp redesign and improve our nation's schools.  \n\t     \n\t     We know that the quality of our children's education \nwill directly impact the future of our economic and social landscape \nin the years to come.  And we thank you so much for your continued \nsupport and commitment to our children's education.  Thank you again.  \n(Applause.)\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  In closing, I would like to also welcome \nthe education leaders in Florida who are here, those representing the \nnational education groups who have also come.  I'd like to recognize \nTracey's congressman, Representative Jim Bacchus in the back, himself \na great advocate of education.  And I'd like to remind all of you \nthat the ultimate purpose of the National Teacher of the Year Award \nis to find a way for the rest of us to express our appreciation to \npeople all across this country who give their lives to our children, \nall of the teachers of this country who get up every day and do their \nbest to try to advance the cause of learning for all the children of \nAmerica.  They are, in so many ways, our most important public \nservants.\n\t     \n\t     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)", "label": 18}
{"text": "I'd *desparately* prefer it if we didn't rehash the same arguments\nthat went on ad infinitum last time.  That's especially true for\nsci.crypt.  For that matter, I've created alt.privacy.clipper, since\nthe traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now.\n\nI'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan, hence my\nfollowup to sci.crypt.  Frankly, if you're not an absolutist, your\nfeelings may turn on some of these issues.  For example -- with an\n80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less\nacceptable than other schemes, because it means that if just one\nrepository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a would-be eavesdropper\nwould need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  I need not point out\nin this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search.\nA slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number,\nand then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys,\nneither of which is useful alone.  That variant is much more resistant\nto attack.  Clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protect\nthe subkeys even more.\n\nOther thoughts...  Some people have noted the size and complexity of\nthe databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could be\ntheir back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories'\npublic keys.  For that matter, they could do that only with session\nkeys, and have no back door at all.  In that case, the FBI would have\nto bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  This\nwould answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you\nmake sure they stop''.\n\nWe can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back\ndoor -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record\nof the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  That provides proof to\nthe escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of\nthe warrant.\n\nI can suggest other variations, too.  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100\npublic key pairs.  Each would be used ~10 times, after which you'd need\nmore keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could be\nused to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant;\nthe keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very\nlong.\n\nI suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart from\nthe obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the\nback door? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concerned\nabout foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  This\nscheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too.  (I've heard\nrumors, over the years, that some factions within NSA were unhappy with\nDES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it, but it\nwas much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)  They're keeping\nthe details secret so that others don't build their own implementations\nwithout the back door.", "label": 11}

When you encounter references to Heaven\nin terms of crowns and harps and golden streets, I trust that you do\nnot suppose (or suspect Christians of supposing) that the golden\nstreets are to be taken literally, still less that they are what the\nconcept of Heaven is all about. Why then should you suppose that\nabout the \"fires\" of Hell?\n     Have you read the novel ATLAS SHRUGGED? Do you remember the\nlast description of James Taggart, sitting on the floor beside the\nFerris Persuader? This comes close to a description of what is meant\nby Hell in my circles. If the image of fire is often used in this\nconnection, there are two reasons that occur to me.\n     The first reason is that it conveys the idea of Hell as\nsomething that any rational being would earnestly wish to avoid (as\nany rational being would wish to avoid the fate of James Taggart --\nbut the latter image is meaningful only to those who have read ATLAS\nSHRUGGED, a smaller audience than those who have played with\nmatches).\n     The second reason is the history of the Hebrew word \"Gehenna,\"\none of the words translated \"Hell\" in the New Testament. It refers\nto the valley of Hinnon, outside Jerusalem. In early days, it was a\nplace where the Canaanites offered human sacrifices (burned alive)\nto Molech. Later, it was made a garbage or refuse dump, where fires\nburned continually, consuming the trash of the city of Jerusalem.\n\"To be cast into Gehenna\" or \"to burn in Gehenna\" thus became a\nmetaphor for \"to be rejected or discarded as worthless.\"\n\nLest you think that identifying Hell with the fate of James Taggart\nis my own private fancy, I commend to you the book THE GREAT\nDIVORCE, by C S Lewis. It discusses Heaven (no harps) and Hell (no\nflames). It is shorter than ATLAS SHRUGGED, and available at most\nbookstores and libraries.", "label": 15}
{"text": "Desiree Bradley (Desiree_Bradley@mindlink.bc.ca) asked us whether we\nshould think of the Serbs as doing God's work in Bosnia.  I've\nrefrained from posting, in hope that someone who is more familiar with\nthe OT than I would answer.  But at this point I feel I have to say\nsomething.\n\nMany things about this posting bother me.  I know of not the slightest\nsuggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate the\nGospel, and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death\nof Moslems violates the heart of the Gospel.  Christ died to break\ndown these distinctions.  In him there is neither Jew nor Greek, there\nis neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female.  If\nMoslems do not know him, we may preach to them, but we don't kill\nthem.  Furthermore, the attack is between states, not religions.\nThere are Christians being attacked as well.  One of the towns under\nattack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems are\nliving together peacefully.\n\nThe precedents being suggested are from the OT.  There are in fact two\ndifferent things being alluded to.  The first is from the entry into\nCanaan.  For that to be a parallel, we would need for God to have\npromised this land through a prophet.  And we would need the war to be\na holy war.  There were tight constraints on behavior in those\nattacks.  Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to be\ndefeated.  Rape would not have been tolerated.  While the accounts in\nJoshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed, note that it was\npossible for a town to make peace with the Israelites, and that once\nthat was done -- even when deception was involved -- they were\nexpected to honor it.  In contrast, there have been many violations of\nagreement in this incident. I see no evidence that God has granted\nBosnia to the Serbs as a promised land, and if he had, their behavior\nwould have disqualified this from being a holy war.\n\nThe other OT parallel is from later, when Israel was defeated by\nAssyria and Babylonia.  The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israel\nfor her sins.  Someone asks whether we shouldn't see this as a\njudgement on the Bosnians for their sins.  This sounds like a replay\nof the old claim that we shouldn't have doctors or hospitals because\nillness is God's judgement.  Yes, even bad things may be used by God\nfor good.  That includes actions of bad people.  But that doesn't\njustify them.  If you read the prophets, you find them very clear that\nin attacking Israel, the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as\n*unintentional* agents of God.  Their intent was to attack God's\npeople, and they would be judged for it.  The fact that they were\nactually carrying out God's plan didn't excuse their action.\nFurthermore, we shouldn't conclude from this that all attacks are\njudgements from God.  God explicitly interpreted that case, through\nhis prophets.  As far as I know, he did not send any prophets to\nBosnia.  While I find it hard to see any good in the current fighting,\nI am sure God will eventually make good come out of bad.  But that\ndoesn't justify it, and it won't save the people who are doing it from\njudgement.", "label": 15}

Furthermore, not all\nwho consider themselves \"christians\" are (even those who manage to head\ntheir own \"churches\").  \"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will\nenter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who\nis in heaven.\" - Matt. 7:21.\n\n\nAgain, what historical documents do you trust?

You\nwrote that \"I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most\nof the teachings of christ\".  Well, Christ referred to God as \"My Father\",\nnot \"My Mother\", and while the \"maleness\" of God is not the same as the\nmaleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not\nhonor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory,\nor politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent\nto do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women - \nenglish just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  After all, God\nchose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human\npopulation.\n\nWell, I'm not about to launch into a detailed discussion of\nthe role of women in Christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in the\nlast 63, and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in this\narticle.

Perhaps by a collision with a smaller,\nalready-existing Neptunian moon, perhaps by a very close passage through\nNeptune's atmosphere - mondo aerobraking!].\n\n  He notes that the two recently discovered \"Kuiper Belt\" objects,\n1992 QB1 and 1993 FW, plus Chiron and Pholus, are all about the same \nmass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the\nlarger bodies of Triton and Pluto/Charon.  Pluto/Charon, he thinks,\nformed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto, knocking some material\ninto a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon; similar to\nideas about the formation of Earth's moon.  There is good evidence\nfrom spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different\n(Pluto has methane frost, Charon doesn't), which can be used as evidence\nfor the impact theory.\n\n  He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objects\nremaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune's \norbit, beyond 35 AU or so.  1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first members\nof this population to be found, in his model.  Note that such bodies\nwill be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane \nfrost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbons\nby now.  The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, I think)\nis that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate,\nand when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it forms\nbright, new frost.  So any bodies much farther away than 30 AU are going\nto be very hard to see.\n\n  I hope I haven't made any errors in the transcription; if you see\na howling mistake, it's undoubtedly mine, not his.\n\n  By the way, he's one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flyby\nmission (I think), and said that the current plans are to use a\nTitan 4 to send the probe on \"just about a rectilinear trajectory\"\nto Pluto (we were speaking loosely at the time...).  He'd like\nto use a Proton, which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs\nMUCH less.  His figures: $500 Million for 2 Titan 4 launches (there\nwill be two separate probes, launched separately), or $120 Million\nfor 2 Proton launches.  He told a story about how the Soviets originally\noffered to sell Proton launches for $30 Million each, but were forced\nto increase their prices in the US in order to be allowed in the\nmarketplace.\n\n  I'm just telling you what he said.\n\n                          Michael\n", "label": 14}

He was a testimonial to their\nstupidity and lies.    \n\nNow before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as \na bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.\n\nThey told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet, \nwhoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into\ntown on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and \nwondered why they didn't pick him up then.  There are two possible answers.\nFirst, they didn't see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, they\ndidn't care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they got\nit.\n\nAfter the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were\ncoming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that.\nWell, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.\n\nDid they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According to\nthem they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised\nKoresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                 \n The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he\n\n\"A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out.\nHis grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh's Real name)  she didn't raise\nDavid Koresh.\"\n\nSomeone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a\nlogical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.\n\nHere's another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that\nthey feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must\nbe done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?\n\nI knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how\nmuch money this was costing.  That was the start of the \"Justification\" part\npart of the plan.  That's when I knew it would come soon.\n\nBut, back to the plan.  It is considered \"Cruel and Unusal Punishment\" to\nexecute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what's acceptable.\n\nThey knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not\nsure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the \ncompound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were\nsupposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.\n\nI spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR\n(Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training\nis going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were\nsubjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical \nagent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.\n\nI have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of\nthing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.\n\nWe waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these\npeople 51 days.  \n\nI stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole\nthing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks\nchanged my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:\n\n\"And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the\noperation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal\nshot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt.\"\n\nIt took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.\n\nOne more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic\nweapons on the premises. \n                                                      \n        HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN!\n\nTHEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE. THEY ALSO KNEW HE HAD IT LEGALLY!\n\nStill, without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him.\nFor all of this my President takes full responsibility.

In fact, effective\nJan. 1, 1993, the fine for possession of a radar detector\naccessable to the driver of a vehicle in VA is now $250.00.  \n\nI have noted an interesting anomality with my Alinco DR-100 2\nmeter ham transceiver.... It will make a *cheap* radar detector\nscream!  I am not sure of the range, but it is obvious by the\nbrake lights that it can be at least 50 feet at 50 watts! :-)", "label": 12}

{"text": "\n     But good ones can collapse somewhat, then come back the next year.\nBurleigh Grimes went from 20+ wins and an ERA of 3 or so in '24 to 13-19 and\nan ERA around 4 in '25.  He pitched well for several more years.  Carlton\nwon 13 and lost 20 the year after his 27-10 record. (Source: Bill James\nHistorical Baseball Abstract.)\n     And let's not forget John Tudor, who started 1-5 and finished 21-6 in\n1985.  He had a pretty bad ERA when you take Busch Stadium into account at\nthe start of the season.\n\n\n     If I recall, he had a 4.50 ERA in the 1st half and a 3.50 ERA in the\n2nd half of last year.  \n     Hmmm, 21 runs in 11 innings.  Suppose he starts 30 more games, and winds\nup w/200 innings pitched.  If he allows 4 runs a game in the next 189\ninnings, he'll have a 4.75 ERA or so at the end of the year. (I think I have\nhis totals right.) This is going to be hard to come back from.\n\n\n     My 1st hunch is that Morris is very gutsy, and that he may be pitching\nthrough an injury and not telling anyone.  My 2nd guess is that he will be\nbanished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more starts.\n(Perhaps when Stewart comes off the DL?  Or will Danny Cox, who went 3 or 4\nscoreless innings against the Tribe today, start for Morris?  He looks like\na really good one.  Gaston is scrambling to find starters, I'd imagine.\nLuckily, the Jays have a very good offense.)\n     I don't think they would dare release him before the end of the year.\nHe'll just be replaced by Stewart or Cox.", "label": 9}

Furthermore, you even deny the \nobvious. There was a genocide of the Muslims carried out by order of \nthe fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government. Massacres of Muslims must be \nstudied in detail, because they are the first modern example of the \nhorrible crime of genocide. Blame must be apportioned to the Armenians\nand their supporters for the murder of Muslims. The Turkish historic \nhomeland, emptied of its native population until today, remains occupied \nby the x-Soviet Armenian Government. Today, x-Soviet Armenia covers up \nthe genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory \nto this crime against humanity. x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime \nof genocide against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making \nreparations to the Turks and Kurds.\n\nThe following are the Jewish and Armenian sources on the cold-blooded\ngenocide perpetrated by the x-Soviet Armenian Government against 2.5\nmillion Muslim people between 1914 and 1920.

Their hope was their participation in the Russian\n success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of\n Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common\n soldiers began deserting in droves.\"\n\n\"With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of\n World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy\n increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks,\n Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations, who in turn\n massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of\n expected arrival of the invading Russian armies.\"\n\n\nSource: Stanford J.

The estimated population\n of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were\n Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.\n Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third\n of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the \n Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan\n uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians\n as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,\n however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the\n guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000\n inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character \n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \n (See also Map 1. Historic Armenia and Map 4. Administrative subdivisions of \n Transcaucasia).\n\nIn 1920, '0' percent Turk. \n\n\"We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as \n ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work \n of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. \n Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts \n into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable \n and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets \n completed the work.

Thus we find this demand on his part for\nquality Greek exegisis to be a hypocritical requirement.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nGood point.  But in your declaring that these passages are contradictory, you\nhave produced only superficial reasonings and observations. Nor have you dug\ndeeper.  I'm glad you have begun in this post.  I will begin Greek studies on\nthese passages in more depth than I thought necessary, as well.\n \nDB...\n\"It would be appropriate to look at what Mr DeCenso has actually USED as\nevidence.  Now we know what he claims for a standard, as he has stated it\noften enough:\n \n \nBut are these actual standards he has used, or simply empty hyperbole.  Let's\nsee, he has used (a), and since he is trying to reconcile it to other\npassages, we see that he has also used (b).  On the other hand he has\npresented no use of:\n \n(d) historical context                or\n(e) historical content                or\n(f) other pertinent historical info   or\n(g) cultural context                  or\n(h) cultural content                  or\n(i) other pertinent cultural info     or\n(j) grammatical construction          or even\n(k) Hebrew and Greek word studies [remember, Archer and Bullinger don't count]\n \nThus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nQuestion:  Do you find such criteria important?  If so, do you plan on starting\nto use them to the best of your ability, or will you continue to present\nshallow observations (I don't mean this in a bad way).\nAt this point in our _debates_, I have not found it necessary to present a\ntotal exegetical analysis of these passages, since we seem to keep beating\naround the bush and not getting into the core of the verses.  I do not believe\nit necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re:\nJudas in Acts and Matthew, but I will do my best from this point on to use\nseveral of the above criteria, since you desire me to.  I hope you will also.\nIt will greatly enhance our study of these passages.\n \nDB...\n\"The only thing he has actually used, beyond the passage itself, is any other\npassage.  Thus Mr DeCenso should be honest and note that most of his list is\nred herring and his only real criteria seems to be:\n \n \nMY REPLY...\nThe reason is simple...you are mistating the passages.  You claim that the\nPASSAGES contradict one another; I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting one\nanother.\n(1) They may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention;\n(2) Matthew may not be presenting Judas' death, as you claim.  But we'll look\nat your defense of this later.\n \nAlso, the \"reward of iniquity\" in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces of\nsilver in Matthew's PASSAGES.  (Although you have a valiant attempt later at\nstating why you believe it is).\n \nAt this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scriptural\ngroundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.\n \nDB...\n\"Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage\nas he has done with Judas' death, is to make it agree with another passage so\nthat both could be considered correct.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nOne of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is\nthat you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these\npassages are complimentary.  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose's\nexplanation of Judas' death...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nHOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING\nHIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND \"FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN\"\n=============================================================\n \nThis question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are\nconstantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent\ndiscrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error.\nSome have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is\ndestroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at\nall.\nMatthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and\nwas crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do\nthey necessarily contradict each other?\nMatthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that\nJudas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling\nsomething black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be\ntrue and supplementary.\nA possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the\nedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there\nfor some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas\nfell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.\nThe fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this\nexplanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the\nvalley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see\nrocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.\nThere are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\nTherefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on\nthis way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are\nnot told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced\nwas the decomposition of his body before his fall.\nLouis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself.\nThis individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a\npistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at\nthe same time.\nOn the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting\nhimself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping\nform the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the\ncase of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a\nsituation of different perspectives of the same event.\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nYour only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit\ninerrancy.  You haven't related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely.\nHere's what you said in an earlier post...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\nDB [quoting Tony Rose]...\n \n\"The added text in this version is so heavy that, assuming you are truly so\nopposed to such tactics, you should find it not credible.  But you seem to\nfind Tony Rose's eisegesis satisfactory, while clearly rejecting David\nJoslin's.\"\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nHere, you discredit Tony's explanation based on what you deem too \"heavy\" for\nthe passages.  But you haven't addressed why you feel that way.  You can say\nit's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me it\ndidn't happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.\n \nQuestions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Or\nare either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such an\nalleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believe\nin this respect.\n \nDB...\n\"At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me:\n \n \nActually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer\nit because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out\nthat hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a\nbit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy\nmovies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nI work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got a\ncall re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother\nis on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a\nlocal hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful.\n \nTo assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is\n\"begging the question\", if I may quote you.\n \n[Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The Christian\nResearch Institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of these\nterms that you use.  I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAM\nshow teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting]\n \nDB...\n\"This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other\nqualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nQualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mention\nbelow.\nDoes hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we\nhave re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it's\nsynonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  But\nhe lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can\ndiscover.\n \nDB...\n\"Now I am not alone in this thought; in fact, since Mr DeCenso so respects\nChristian scholarly (including Greek scholars) opinion, I did some research.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nThank you, Dave.\n \nDB...\n\"Interestingly, not one of the Christian references I read, interpreted the\nhanging as being anything but a fatal suicide.              ^^^^^^^^^^^\n \nMY REPLY...\n[^^^ above, mine]\nSo it's OK to use Christian sources to back your points?  What about Tony's\nposition.  Do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility?\n \nAlso, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, or\ndeceived in other parts of their books?  If so, should we do, as we have done\nwith Archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including\ntheir \"interpretation\" of the hanging of Judas?  I am sure _you_ would find\nsome errors and maybe even some deception in those sources.\n \nYou also noted they \"interpreted\" the hanging as meaning he died.  Although\nthat is very possibly true, do you find that in the text itself?  Remember,\nthat's the first criteria we must examine.\n \nDB...\n\"This included:\n \n    \"The Biblical Knowledge Commentary\" by Woodward and Zuck\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nWhich I own.

Maybe we are getting somewhere\nin how we both should approach these alleged contradictions - more in depth\nstudy.\n \nDB...\n\"In each case, these references specifically describe that the interpretation\nof Matt 27:5 as successful, suicide and thus I can only conclude that the\n                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nGreek word \"apagchw\"(ie: hang oneself) is translated as a successful hanging.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\n[^^^ above, mine]\nNo you can't only conclude this, although, as Tony says, this was a highly\nprobable outcome.  But Matthew does not state death as being a result.\n \nThe Greek word is APAGCHO.  Matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the New\nTestament.\n \nIn the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),\nit's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was\nnot followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his\ncity. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he\nwas buried in his father's tomb.\"             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n \nNotice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel \"hanged himself\" [Gr. Sept.,\nAPAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, \"and died\".  Here we have no doubt of the\nresult.\nIn Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.\n \nAlso, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply\nmeans \"hang oneself\".\n \nDB...\n\"But Mr DeCenso, you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable\n                                                                     ^^^^^^^^^\nChristian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\n[^^^above, mine]\n\"Reputable\"?  You mean ones that have never erred?\nAs far as   insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful, that can't be done,\neven by me. ^^^^^^^^^\n \nAs I said in an earlier post...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\nAlthough I still agree with Tony's exegesis as being the most probable\nexplanation regarding Judas' death (taking into account several criteria),\nI've recently noticed some new things in Matthew.\n \nMAT 27:5-8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,\nand went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and\nsaid, \"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the\nprice of blood.\" And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's\nfield, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of\nBlood to this day.\n \nFirst of all, notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of\nhanging. All it says is that he \"went and hanged himself.\" Luke however, in\nActs, tells us that \"and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all\nhis entrails gushed out.\" This is a pretty clear indication (along with the\nother details given in Acts - Peter's speech, the need to pick a new apostle,\netc.) that at least after Judas' fall, he was dead. So the whole concept that\n                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nMatthew and Luke both recount Judas' death is highly probable, but not clear\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\ncut.\n^^^\n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nI also wrote...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\nMY REPLY...\n \nHere we have a stickler, Dave, that I have to say I just recently noticed.\nLet's look at the passage in Matthew:\n \nMAT 27:4 saying, \"I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.\" And they said,\n\"What is that to us? You see to it!\"\n \nMAT 27:5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,\nand went and hanged himself.\n \nMAT 27:6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, \"It is not\nlawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.\"\n \nMAT 27:7 And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field,\nto bury strangers in.\n \nMAT 27:8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.\n \nNotice verse 5...\"Then he...went and hanged himself.\"\nMatthew does not say Judas died, does it?  Should we assume he died as a\nresult of the hanging?                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWhat does Acts say?\nACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and\nfalling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.\n \nACT 1:20 \"For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be\ndesolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'\n \nHere we may have a graphic explanation of Judas' death....So, my line of\nreasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re:the \"two\" accounts of Judas'\ndeath is this...Matthew doesn't necessarily explain how Judas died; he does\n                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nsay Judas \"hanged himself\", but he didn't specifically say Judas died in the\nhanging incident.               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nHowever, Acts seems to show us his graphic demise.  Therefore, there is no\ncontradiction between Matthew and Acts re: Judas' `death'.\n \n.......\n \nMY REPLY...\n...we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records\nhis death.  Although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging\nand hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, I can no longer assume that to be\nthe case.  Therefore, no contradiction.  Matthew did not say Judas died as a\n                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nresult of the hanging, did he?  Most scholars believe he probably did, but...?\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n______________________________________________________________________\n \nI quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars' explanations, but\nin looking at the texts initially, we can't assume Judas died.  It is, however,\nhighly probable.                            ^^^^^^\n \nDB...\n\"By the way, while all agree that Judas died from the hanging, the books had\ndifferent ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing.  One\nsimply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew's version as\nthe correct version in both Matt and Acts.  \"The Biblical Knowledge Commentary\"\nsuggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly\nexploded (which doesn't explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope\nbroke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn't explain\nhow a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first).\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nThe outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person\nwas suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may\nhave deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell\nupon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In a\nsuperficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not\ngiven a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted\npost gave us some...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\nA possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the\nedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there\nfor some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas\nfell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.\nThe fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this\nexplanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the\nvalley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see\nrocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.\nThere are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\nTherefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on\nthis way down, tearing his body open.\n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nDB...\nNow truthfully, I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the\nsource of the Potter's field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is\ncorrect: Matthew does make that confusion.  Of course a Biblical inerrantist\nwho claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have to\nthereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where the\nprophesy of the Potter's field came from).\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nPlease, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss\nthis with you.\n \nDB...\nAs to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the\nmoney with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather\nthan some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically\nmention \"the reward of iniquity\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions\nwhat act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \"...concerning\nJudas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\").  Now I would point out\nthat when the Bible describes an act of \"iniquity,\" and then immediately\ndiscusses \"*the* reward of iniquity,\" it would be rather inane to suggest that\nit was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nDave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we!\n \nACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples\n(altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said,\nACT 1:16 \"Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy\nSpirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide\nto those who arrested Jesus;\nACT 1:17 \"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\"\nACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and\nfalling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.\nACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field\nis called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)\nACT 1:20 \"For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be\ndesolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'\n \nNotice that in verse 16, the word \"iniquity\" is not used.  Rather, it states\nthat Judas \"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\".\nBut the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \"for he was numbered with us and\nobtained a part in this ministry.\"  What part did Judas play in their ministry?\n         ^^^^^^\nJOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a\nthief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it.\nJOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had\nsaid to him, \"Buy those things we need for the feast,\" or that he should give\nsomething to the poor.\n \nSo, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se.\nRight after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer,\naccording to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of \"wages of\niniquity\" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen\nby Judas to purchase a field.  I believe this is a better exegetical\nexplanation of what the \"wages of iniquity\" are.  What do you think, Dave?\n \nDB...\n\"Now since I have given you clear answers (and even references), perhaps you\ncould unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are (instead of asking\nme what type I think you are, as you did to Mr Joslin).\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nI will gladly admit that I am a Complete Inerrantist, although I do not have\nthat big a problem with the Limited Inerrancy view.\n\nFrank", "label": 19}

The humbling lessons left to us\n  by martyrs and saints?\nWe'd rather engage in never-ending bickering and disproof of each other's\n  opinion - looking at each other's mistakes - for the sake of arguments,\n  instead of having communion in one body with Christ.\nWhat makes us go blind to the truth that God is All Powerful and that He can\n  not be binded by what people wrote and have written about Him in all ages?\nWhy is our faith in God limited?  By all the words and literature we muster?\nWhat prevents us from going *beyond* being saved and extend God's rich love\n  to others who are not?\n\nWhy are our eyes not wide open to see that He continuously sees our faith, hope\n  and love which glorify Him and so He gives us indications of His \n  acknowledgements with signs/miracles (ordinary/common or divinely inspired) \n  everywhere?  Isn't that like an atheist/agnostic's view that all these\n  are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural?\n\nWhy then does the Holy Mother comes back to remind us:\n  \"We must really __accept that prayer__ changes the course of things and that\n  with prayers __even wars can be prevented__.\"\nbut then she continues:\n  \"You often have an egotistic attitude.  Dear children, in these days you\n  have prayed very much, __but your hands have remained empty__.\"\nWhy hesitate in proclaiming what needs to be done:\n  \"prayer, conversion, peace, penance, fasting, the Holy Mass, living life\n  as what the Gospel brings.\"?\nWhy not do so?  How?  To the world?\n  \"Start in your family.  Be a good example.  Live the Word.\"\nWhy worry if it is going to be of good use to many?\n  \"The fruits, __leave them to the Lord__, do not worry about anything or \n  anyone but entrust yourself to the Lord.\"\n\nAlthough the Holy Mother does not insist because:\n  \"You are free; I bow before the freedom which God gives you.\"\nbut she follows this with:\n  \"You are surprised because I say to you: Decide for God and yet, see how\n  you have lived this day.\"\nWhy does she constantly conveys:\n  \"Take this life toward God in the way as to __experience__ the Lord Himself\n  in your __behavior__ and __not only__ when you pray\" or one time when we \n  decide that we are saved, or talk/write about God, etc.\nThe Holy Mother warns:\n  \"Satan (the serpent) is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from\n  my peace plan and prayer.\"  (Rev 12:17, the dragon became angry with the woman\n  and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings, those who keep\n  God's commandments, and bear witness to Jesus.)\n\nDo you have fear or hate for God's current messenger of true peace, love and\n  our motherly protector from the anti-Christ?\nThe one who is being apprehensive of communism, wars, famine and other evils\n  that the serpent brings upon us? \nThis obedient and blessed new Eve?\nThe mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against Satan?\nHaven't there been renewed faith, hope, love, peace and obedience wherever\n  this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that God has given her\n  in good purpose?\nWhy do we choose to be blind?\nWhy fear the truth that God has been giving us a chance and sharing Christ's\n  ever-forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother?\nThe mother who has been consecrated the task __to reverse__ the disobedient\n  harm and example done by the ancient Eve.\nShe has been preparing the new Eden with her Immaculate Heart.\nThe new Eden as sanctuary (the womb) for the next coming and judgement of the \n  righteous by our Lord, Jesus Christ; when The Lamb marries His bride.\nShouldn't we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the\n  second coming of her Son as she has been conceived without sin to bear\n  the Son of God in her womb?\nWhy fear true peace, love and renewed faith and obedience to God that Mary\n  faithfully brings to God's children?  She has been protecting the flock\n  (the rest of the offsprings) from the greedy dragon so as to present more \n  righteous members for her Son's coming.\nNot all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy\n  of belief.  With prayer and guidance from the Holy Spirit and, of course,\n  approval of our Church authorities, we should be aware of the true and\n  divinely inspired ones; specifically, the ones which aligns with the\n  Scripture.\n  \n\nAlso, our Lady reminds us of recommendation of __silence__ in our prayers:\n  \"If you speak unceasingly in your prayers, how will you be able to hear\n  God?  Allow Him room to answer you, to speak to you.\" \n\nShe encourages us (with motherly nurturing) to continue in exuberant \nfaith, hope and love to Jesus, constantly.  NOT with mere emotions, \nbut with deep, constant obedience to Jesus, her Beloved Son and\nacknowledgement of our need to have Him as part of our lives.\n\nLet's not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the life\nthat God wants us to live; when there won't be enough time or when\nit will be late.\n                                                      \nNowadays, Mary says, \n\"Pray, pray, pray for peace...reconciliation, my children.\"\nHave peace within yourself first before you can promote peace to\nothers.  For without peace, you can not fully accept my Son.\"\n                                                                       \n\nAnd you think she's just an ordinary lady.  Not to me.  She's\nour good Mother/messenger from God and she is so nice enough to\nshare God's kingdom to us through her Son and experience it.\n\nWith Mary, we are assured that The Lamb always succeeds.\n\n-----\nNote:  All enclosed in quotes are from \"Latest News of Medjugorje\"\n       Number 10, June, 1991 by Fr.

During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian\n was permitted to approach the city and its environs.\n\n While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained\n in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the\n area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to \n attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the\n plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder\n of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by\n the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers\n who had remained in the rear during the war.\n\n One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of\n soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of\n seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,\n and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud\n and dirt...\n\n It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and\n traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds\n and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night\n patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The \n Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear\n also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the\n trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for\n fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder\n and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.\n\n Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir\n Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander\n in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.\n The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals\n that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its\n highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half\n of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.\n\n ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,\n Odishelidge. They were as follows:\n\n The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the\n act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...\n More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been\n killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless \n Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the\n murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood \n near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:\n 'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten\n more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when\n the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.\n\n The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently\n fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.\n Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw\n towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew\n to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and\n destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.\n\n During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages\n that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the \n Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers\n were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time\n when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill\n the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries\n of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the \n Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would\n have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from\n acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with\n hatred and loathing.\n\n Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that\n he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The\n Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the\n stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since\n the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed\n in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen\n of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping\n him with the iron heel of his boot.\n\n Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape\n from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off\n by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered\n children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village\n of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:\n\n There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.\n Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and\n spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about\n 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 \n centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,\n children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of\n rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.\n\n A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators\n for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov\n to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be \n proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's\n disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,\n instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely\n reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told\n the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more\n licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent\n and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity\n and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,\n the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and\n claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.\n\n An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command\n narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:\n\n The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut\n out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head.\n The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men \n of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they\n took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people\n among this group were able to save their lives as the result of\n my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were \n released when they learnt that I understood what was going on. \n Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the\n Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered\n on the streets.\n\n On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent\n Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were\n threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for\n murdering an innocent Turk. \n\n When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would \n be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare\n you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the \n Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard\n that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within\n the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same \n day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to\n him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible\n act. However no result was achieved.\n\n In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a\n natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived\n the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the \n Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had\n been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. \n The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed\n one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached\n three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details\n of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers\n were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even\n withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred\n people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading\n Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.\n However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with\n the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower\n classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders\n of the leading Armenian figures and commanders. \n\n I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals\n were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who\n opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that\n it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.\n Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian\n cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have\n supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred\n to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by\n the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians.\n You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a\n conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear\n of the Turkish soldiers.\n\n The incidents that occurred only recently clearly manifest the real\n nature of the Armenian ideology. Nothing which is already done can\n be undone.\"\n\nSerdar Argic", "label": 17}

{"text": "I'd like to share my thoughts on this topic of \"arrogance of\nChristians\" and look forward to any responses.  In my\nencounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their\nbelief that their faith is total truth.  According to them,\ntheir beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of\nGod and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance\nmakes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own\nhesitations about Christianity because they see no other way.\nTheir way is the 'truth.'\n\nBut I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe\na particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason,\nbut it seems to me a choice.\n\nMy discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard\ndiscussions when I was in grade school:\n\nA kid would say, \"All policemen are jerks!\"  I'd ask, \"How do\nyou know?\"  \"Because my daddy told me so!\"  \"How do you know\nyou're daddy is right?\"  \"He says he's always right!\"\n\nWell the argument usually stops right there.  In the end,\naren't we all just kids, groping for the truth?  If so, do we have\nthe authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as\nfalse?\n\n-------------\n\nThis is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup.  I\napologize if I'm covering tired old ground.  Some of the\ndiscussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcome\nany comments.\n\n-- \n\n[I'm sort of mystified about how a Christian might respond to this.  I\ncan understand criticisms of Christianity that say there's not enough\nevidence to believe it, or that there's just as good evidence for\nother religions.  I don't agree, but clearly there are plenty of\nintelligent people who don't find the evidence convincing.  But that\ndoesn't seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who\nbelieve Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict\nit are false.\n\nThis suggests a model of spiritual things that's rather different than\nthe Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where\npeople choose what value to follow, but there's no actual independent\nspiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in\nsome unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of\none sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But\nChristianity is in its essense a \"historical\" religion.  That is, it's\nbased on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out\nthere, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways,\nand that we see evidence of that in history.  In the \"mundane\" world,\nwe are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it\nfalls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn't).  The\nChristian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual\nexternal reality.  I hope we're all honest enough not to claim that we\nhave perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know\neverything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that\nimplies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don't\nsee how else we could proceed.\n\nThis needn't result in arrogance.  I'm certainly interested in talking\nwith people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and\neven if they don't, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it's\ngot to be possible to respect people and also think that on some\nmatters they are wrong.  Maybe even disasterously wrong.", "label": 15}

{"text": "\nThe number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and \nexploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media.  The\nfacts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians \nin any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly\nto the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques\nwhich were technically possible only recently.\n\nThe idea that \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi citizens died is\nludicrous.  Not even \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi soldiers died,\nand they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US\nand its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians?\nEither the smart bombs didn't hit their targets (and we know they did),\nor they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to\ndestroying Iraq's military potential.  The military mission planners are\nnot fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war.\nHitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you,\nnot a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their\ntyrant-dictator. \n\nHow about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2?\nI don't hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science, but\nwith smart bombs, it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage\nof civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are\nmisidentified; innocents die.  That's war the way it really is.\nBut the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth\nlike it's one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is\nworse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, \"I know not what\ncourse others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me\ndeath!\"  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one\nwishes to stay free.   \n\n\nMathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here.\nYou come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I\nfeel sure that was not your intent.\n\nSo the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?  I'm sure that appeasement would have\nworked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we\nshouldn't have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent\nGerman civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor \nFrench who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We \nshould have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you'd be speaking\nGerman instead of English right now.\n\nTyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don't understand\ndiplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is\nthat Bush wimped out and didn't have the military roll into Baghdad, so\nnow Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people's sacrifice (not to\nmention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait \nwas a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would've been better!\n\nAnd as for poor, poor Rodney King!

When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a\ntrial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply\nlowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind\nwhich your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends\nto support in the case against the policemen.  \n\nLaw in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused,\nwhether they be criminals or cops.

Lots of work, and imminent graduation have come in the way of \nposting one of these for March or earlier this month -- for which I apologize.\n\nThis file includes information on writing a script for University of Minnesota\nPHONE, and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with \nPHONE. \n\nFor additions, modifications and corrections, I can be reached at\n<ashok@biochemistry.cwru.edu>\n\nBest wishes,\nAshok\n\n-- begin SLIP.TXT --\nBased on my experiences on setting up SLIP under DOS and Windows,  here\nare my comments on setting up SLIP in this environment.  I thank the\nTrumpet beta testers and the CWRU SLIP beta testers for their comments.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nConfiguring your Modem:\n\na) Turn off DTR (AT&D0&W)\n   I have to disable DTR because the communication program that I use\n   to dial my SLIP server (QMODEM) drops DTR when I exit the program\n   and therefore hangs up the line.  If you use a program like Kermit\n   or Conex to establish the SLIP connection, then this need not be done.\n   These programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit.\n\n   NOTE: If you use Univ. of Minn. PHONE to dial and establish a\n         SLIP connection, you do not need to turn off DTR.\n\nb) Dial and establish the SLIP connection first.  This can be done\n   automatically if you use a program like PHONE (from the University of\n   Minnesota) which will dial and establish a SLIP connection then load the\n   SLIP packet driver.  The PHONE scripting language is simple and\n   phone scripts can be easily written to configure PHONE to work with\n   other SLIP server.  In addition, while the only packet driver\n   that PHONE works with is UMSLIP (currently), it is easy to write a\n   batch file hack that lets PHONE work with other packet drivers.\n   There is a section on PHONE in the document with both script and\n   batch file examples.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nConfiguring the SLIP drivers:\n\nThere are five SLIP packet drivers commonly available\nCSLIPPER.EXE    Peter Tattam's compressed SLIP driver\nSLIPPER.EXE     Peter Tattam's SLIP driver\nSLIP8250.COM    Crynwr driver (I like Phil Burn's modified driver)\nETHERSL.COM     Crynwr driver (ethernet simulation over SLIP)\nUMSLIP.COM      Univ. of Minnesota driver (based on SLIP8250)\n\nOf these four, I vastly prefer C/SLIPPER.EXE over SLIP8250.COM or\nETHERSL.COM for the following reasons:\n\na) It is much faster even though my modem has just a 16450 UART\nb) While using EtherSLIP/SLIP8250/UMSLIP, myself and several others\n   have noticed that the PC clock gets messed up after performing a\n   long FTP transfer.\nc) It supports PKTMUX when used in ethernet simulation mode\nd) When used in Ethernet simulation mode C/SLIPPER seem to work with\n   every TCP/IP application that I have tested it with.\n\nInstructions for C/SLIPPER.EXE (and you do not use PHONE)\na) Load SLIPPER in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file according to instructions:\n   For instance if you have a v.32bis modem on COM1\n   slipper com1 vec=62 baud=57600\nb) If you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Win 3.1 DOS boxes, then use the\n   double-ended packet driver shim WinPKT.COM -- this creates a virtual\n   packet driver at 0x60.  DOS applications in native mode, DOS\n   applications in Windows 3.1 DOS boxes and Windows applications can all\n   use this virtual driver at 0x60.\n   winpkt.com 0x60 0x62\nc) If you use QVT/Net, load PKTINT.COM next.  QVT/net is configured in\n   QVTNET.INI to use the interrupt at 0x60.\n   pktint.com\n\nInstructions for SLIP8250.COM:\na) Try getting a version 10 SLIP driver.  Philip Burns of Northwestern\n   University has a modified SLIP8250.COM driver that is better at hardware\n   handshaking.  This driver is distributed along with NuPOP.\nb) Load the driver AFTER establishing the SLIP connection.  My modem is a\n   V.32bis modem on COM1, so here is how I would load the driver.\n   slip8250 -w 0x62 -h 4 SLIP 0x03f8 57600\nc) As discussed above if you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Windows 3.x\n   DOS boxes, you probably want to use WINPKT.COM\n   winpkt.com 0x60 0x62\nd) If you use WinQVT/net, load PKTINT.COM\n   pktint.com\n\nInstructions for ETHERSL.COM:\nIf you choose to use ETHERSL.COM instead of SLIP8250.COM, the\ninstructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference.  You\nwill have to DELETE the line \"device=*vcd\" from the [386Enh] section\nof SYSTEM.INI.  This will interfere with running regular Windows Comm\napplications (such as Crosstalk), and you will get lots of dropped\ncharacters etc. in these applications.  This is therefore not\nrecommended.  ETHERSLIP would be loaded as:\n   ethersl -w 0x62 -h 4 0x03f8 57600\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nConfiguring Windows 3.1:\n\na) Make the following modifications to the SYSTEM.INI file [386Enh]\n   section.\n   i) List all your COM ports, with their addresses and interrupts.\n       COM1Base=03F8\n       COM1Irq=4\n       COM2Base=02F8\n       COM2Irq=3\n       COM3Base=03E8\n       COM3Irq=5\n       This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel,\n       but double-clicking on the \"Ports\" icon.\n   ii) Give the port to which your modem is attached a generous COM buffer\n       COM1Buffer=10000\n   iii) Change the COM port AutoAssign value for the COM port that you wish\n       to use for your modem to ZERO.  This is the amount of time that\n       Windows waits in seconds before handing control of that COM port to\n       another application.  If you use WinQVT/net and then want to switch\n       from one session to another, and this value is at the default value\n       of 2 seconds, you are will get a GPF and Windows will crash.\n       COM1AutoAssign=0\n       This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel.\n       Double-click on 386 Enhanced, and under \"Device Contention\", set\n       the device contention for the COM port your modem is on to\n       \"Never Warn\"\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional notes:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat to do if you are assigned a different IP address for each\nSLIP session?\n\nI am fortunate in that our campus SLIP server assigns each user\na permanent IP address, so I do not have worry about editing QVTNET.INI\neach time that I establish a SLIP connection.\n\nIf you are assigned a new IP address on every occasion that you dial in,\nplease try to use BOOTP aware software, and let BOOTP do the\nconfiguration for you.  However, QVTnet is not BOOTP aware and RARP\nwill not work over a SLIP connection.  To get QVTNet working in a\nsituation such as this, you must do the following:\n\nEdit the QVTNET.INI file.  Let the [net] section look like this:\n\n[net]\nname=\nip=\nnetmask=255.255.255.0 (or whatever is appropriate for you)\narptime=20\npacket_vector=60 (or whatever is appropriate)\n\nSave the changes, and then *write-protect* this file\n\"attrib +r qvtnet.ini\"\n\nStart your slip connection, and *remember* the name and IP address\nthat you are assigned.  Each time you start QVT/net 3.1x, the\ngeneral configuration dialog box will open.  Enter the name and\nIP address and you were assigned for that session, click on [OK],\nand you should be up and running.  The changes you make will not\nbe saved, as QVTNET.INI is write-protected.\n\nA more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic SLIP IP address\nassignment is provided by Victor Menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)\nVictor uses the program bootpq to semi-automate qvtnet preparation.\nBootpq is used to inquire the assigned IP, which is then saved to a\nfile called \"myip\".  Another file \"noip\" is essentially a complete\nQVTNET.INI file that lacks the IP address.  In the final step \"myip\"\nand \"noip\" are copied into a single QVTNET.INI file.  An example of\nVictor's batch file is provided below:\n=====================================================\nslipper com2\npktint.com\nbootpq -i \"ip=\\\"%%s\\\"\"  >> myip\nbootpq -i \"My IP# is: %s\"\ncopy /q net + myip + noip e:\\com\\qvtnet\\qvtnet.ini\ndel /q myip\n@echo off\necho .\necho Ready to run WinQVTnet\n=====================================================\nFor questions and more details about bootpq, please contact Victor\nMenayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)\n\nQPC Software is attempting to add BOOTP capability to WinQVT/net.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nHow do you use PKTMUX over SLIP?\n\nPKTMUX will not work over the SLIP8250.COM packet driver, and crashes\nimmediately if used with ETHERSL.COM\n\nPKTMUX will work with C/SLIPPER.EXE, when C/SLIPPER is used in ethernet\nsimulation mode.  An example of this configuration is shown below:\n\nThe latest release of PKTMUX is 1.2c; and it is important that you\nuse this version, if you want to use virtual packet drivers with\napplications like Trumpet for Windows (to be released very shortly).\n\n[from AUTOEXEC.BAT]\n\nlh c/slipper com1 vec=65 baud=57600 ether         (packet driver)\nlh pktmux 5 65 /5       (pktmux loaded for 5 virtual packet drivers)\nlh pktdrv 7f 65         (first virtual packet driver used for QVT/net)\nlh pktint.com           (QVT/net pktint.com)\npktdrv 63 65            (PKTDRV for use in native DOS or WinTrumpet)\n\nAdditional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from within\nWindows 3.1 DOS boxes.  For example, my PIF file to load POPmail is\ndirected to the file \"popmail.bat\".  This is what popmail.bat reads\nlike:\n\npktdrv 60 65            loads a virtual packet driver at 0x60\ncd \\popmail\npopmail\ncd \\\npktdrv 60 /u            unloads the packet driver at 0x60\nexit                    causes the DOS window to close\n\nI have similar batch files that load other DOS TCP/IP applications\nlike PC Gopher.  It is my experience that PKTMUX works fine\neven if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual DOS\nsessions, are loaded at the same software interrupt.  For example\nwithin two different DOS boxes -- one for POPmail and the other for\nGopher, the virtual packet driver (pktdrv) is loaded at 0x60 in each\ninstance.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nHow much does PKTMUX degrade the performance of C/SLIPPER?\n\nI have a V.32bis/V.42bis modem in a 386-33 running Windows 3.1 with\na reasonably fast video card (ATI Graphics Ultra).  Under these\nconditions, when I have three virtual packet drivers loaded and\nbeing used as follows:\na) Driver at 0x7f -- QVTNet FTP client session\nb) Driver at 0x60 in one DOS Window -- CUTCP tn3270 session\nc) Driver at 0x60 in another DOS Window -- Trumpet for DOS\n\nI get FTP transfer rates of 0.8 - 1.0 kb/sec while transferring\ncompressed files.  This rate is comparable to that which I get with\nSLIP8250 loaded as a packet driver, and where a single TCP/IP session\nis active.  If CSLIPPER is used a packet driver and a single session\nis active, I get transfer rates of 1.3 - 1.4 kb/sec on the same\nfiles.\n\nWhile there is about 40% degradation in the performance of SLIPPER,\nfor me the benefits of being able to use PKTMUX outweigh the\nperformance hit.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nC/SLIPPER and ethernet simulation mode\n\nIn ethernet simulation mode, C/SLIPPER ver 1.3 works with all the\napplications that I have tested it with.  One or two applications\nthat required ethernet simulation balked at C/SLIPPER 1.2, but even\nthese rare problems have been resolved with ver 1.3\n\nWhen SLIPPER is used in ethernet simulation mode, and used with PKTMUX,\nI get some an error message in the QVTNet Console window that reads\n\"IP:incorrect packet type\" or \"IP:bad version number\".  This does not\nseem to prevent QVTnet from functioning, although I cannot comment on\nloss of performance.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat can you do if your DOS TCP/IP application does not work with\nC/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode?\n\nIn the rare event that you find a package that does not work with\nC/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode, first contact the author --\nPeter Tattam -- PETER@psychnet.psychol.utas.edu.au, and let him\nknow.  Chances are that he can fix it.\n\nIn the meanwhile, you can try the following.  I do not know if it is\nkosher, but it worked when I had problems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.2\n\n(C/SLIPPER is loaded at 0x62 as described above under the PKTMUX section)\n\nI load ETHERSL.COM at 0x60, run the application and then terminate\nETHERSL.COM\n\nThis also works within Windows 3.1 virtual DOS boxes.  However a\npacket driver like ETHERSL can be used in only one virtual DOS box\nat a time.\n\nSo for example, here is my batch file to run Grateful Med (a\nmedical reference retrieval program developed at the National Library\nof Medicine).\n\nethersl -w 0x60 -h 4 0x03f8 57600       loads ETHERSLIP\ncd \\gm6\nsearch\ncd \\\ntermin 0x60                             terminates ETHERSLIP\nexit            closes the DOS box and returns me to Windows\n\nIf you use this method, be cautious about one thing -- don't have\nany active PKTMUX DOS sessions open at the same time.  After closing\nthe ETHERSL window, you can run your PKTMUX DOS sessions with no\nproblem.  BTW, the example above -- Grateful Med, works with no\nproblems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.3\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nPHONE Script Files:\n\nThe documentation that accompany PHONE, provide good instructions on\nwriting script files to get PHONE to dial SLIP servers other than\nthe University of Minnesota server.  For example here is a script\nthat I use to dial a CISCO server at the University that I attend.\n\nBackground:  To start a SLIP connection, I dial our terminal server,\nand login with a username and password.  After doing so, I start a SLIP\nsession with the following command \"slip username-slip.dialin.cwru.edu\",\nfollowed by my password -- again.\n\nHere then is the relevant portion of the PHONE.CMD script file -\n#\n# CWRU-TS2 SLIP login script by Ashok Aiyar 3/26/93\n# Last revised 3/28/93\nProcedure    Host.CWRU.Login\nTimeOut 60      'CWRU-TS2 terminal server is not responding'\nMessage         \"CWRU-TS2 SLIP login script -- Version 1.1\"\nMessage         'Waiting for SLIP server to respond'\nQuiet ON\nExpect 'Verification'\nMessage         'Request for User Verification Received from CWRU-TS2'\nMessage         'Sending your user name and password'\nQuiet OFF\nExpect   'Username:'\nSend '%u<'\nExpect   'Password:'\nPrivate\nSend '%p<'\nReject    'Access denied'   'Your user name or password was not accepted'\nTimeOut 30    'SLIP server did not respond to your validation request'\nExpect 'CWRU-TS2>'\nSend 'SLIP<'\nTimeOut 10    'SLIP server did not respond to SLIP command'\nExpect 'IP hostname or address:'\nSend '%u-slip.dialin.cwru.edu<'\nTimeOut 10 'SLIP server did not respond to hostname'\nReject    'Bad IP address'   'Incorrect Hostname'\nExpect 'Password:'\nSend '%p<'\nReject    'Access denied'    'Password not accepted.'\nTimeOut 10\nExpect 'Header Compression will match your system'\nMessage 'Login to CWRU SLIP server successful'\nWait 1.0\nEndProcedure   Host.CWRU.Login\n#\n#\nProcedure      Host.CWRU.LogOut\n# Nothing special needs to be done to logout\nEndProcedure   Host.CWRU.LogOut\n#\n#   End of Script file\n#\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nHow to use packet drivers other than UMSLIP with PHONE?\n\nThe quick answer -- there is no \"clean\" way.  Below is a batch file\nhack that I wrote to use PHONE with other packet drivers.  In this\nexample, the packet driver is Peter Tattam's CSLIPPER.  To use a\nbatch file like this, you must know the parameters with which you\nplan to use the packet driver -- i.e interrupt vector, baud rate,\nport address, and IRQ.  This batch file requires UMSLIP.COM,\nCSLIPPER.EXE, and TERMIN.COM to be in the same directory\nor in your path ...\n\nAll that the BATCH file does is to let you dial the SLIP connection\nusing PHONE, load the appropriate packet driver, hangup the\nconnection, and unload the driver when you are done ...\n\n-- being CWRUSLIP.BAT --\n@echo off\nrem   this batch file is an ugly hack of U. of Minn. \"SLIP.BAT\"\nrem   awaiting a version of C/SLIPPER that can directly interact\nrem   with PHONE\nrem   CWRUSLIP.BAT file is used with PHONE.EXE to start a SLIP\nrem   connection on CWRU-TS2\nrem   last modified 3/28/93 -- Ashok Aiyar\n\n@echo off\ncls\ngoto start\n\n:start\nif %1. == ?.         goto help\nif %1. == help.      goto help\nif %1. == setup.     goto setup\nif %1. == dial.      goto forceD\nif %1. == hangup.    goto forceH\nif %1. == quit.      goto forceH\nif %1. == HELP.      goto help\nif %1. == SETUP.     goto setup\nif %1. == DIAL.      goto forceD\nif %1. == QUIT.      goto forceH\ngoto bogus\ngoto unload\n\n:forceH\ntermin 0x60\numslip >nul\nphone force hangup\ngoto unload\n\n:slipper\ntermin 0x60\nREM  the following line must be changed to reflect the COM port,\nREM  IRQ, baud rate, and software interrupt\nlh c:\\packet\\cslipper com1 vec=60 baud=57600 ether\ngoto end\n\n:forceD\ntermin 0x60\numslip >nul\nphone force dial\ngoto slipper\n\n:setup\ntermin 0x60\numslip >nul\nphone setup\ngoto help\n\n:unload\ntermin 0x60\ngoto end\n\n:bogus\necho %1 is not a valid command.\necho Try \"cwruslip help\" for a list of valid commands\necho.\n\n:help\necho --------------------------------------------------------------\necho           Case Western Reserve University SLIP Setup\necho                  using Univ. of Minnesota PHONE\necho --------------------------------------------------------------\necho cwruslip setup     modem settings, phone number, username etc.\necho.\necho cwruslip dial      DIAL and establish the SLIP connection\necho cwruslip quit      HANGUP the phone and unload the driver\necho cwruslip help      this screen\necho.\n\n:end\n-- end CWRUSLIP.BAT --\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhere to Get What.....\n\nPeter Tattam's programs are archived at ftp.utas.edu.au (C/SLIPPER,\nand the Trumpet set of programs).\n\nWinQVT/net is generally archived at most Windows FTP sites,\nincluding ftp.cica.indiana.edu\n\nNCSA Telnet is archived at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu\n\nNuPOP is archived at ftp.acns.nwu.edu\n\nPOPmail/PC, SLIPDISK, PHONE, and PC Gopher are archived at\nboombox.micro.umn.edu\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n-- end SLIP.TXT --\n\n\n", "label": 2}

And it has been quoted \"at\" me often\nenough by those who don't believe I take it seriously, that Jesus (is said\nto have) said, \"If you love me, you will obey my commands.\"  [John 14:15]\n\nI am, like any Christian, the slave of Christ, and it is my will that I\nshould do as He wills me to do.  I am (also, or instead) His younger brother,\nbut still under His direction, though we both call God \"Abba.\"  Christians,\ntherefore, will try to find what it is that their Lord commands them, and\ndiscovering it will feel obligated to do it, or to confess their failure.\nReaders here may set aside the theologizing jargon (such as \"slaves of\nChrist\") -- the point is that adherents of a religion *will* read the texts\n(whether classified as \"inspired\" or not) that are held up as models, in an\neffort to find application to their own situations.  This practice ranges\nfrom \"devotional\" reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon-\nical scripture as \"the Word of God.\"  And at the highest pitch, this leads\nto a question of whether we *can* find in inspired scripture something that\ncan act as \"absolute\" guidance for our actions.\n\nThe problem is in finding out just *what* it is our Lord commands.  I am\ngoing to set aside for this essay one major direction in which Christians\nhave looked for these commands, namely Christian tradition.  That is not\nbecause *I* reject tradition, but because my primary audience in this essay\nis Protestants, who deny tradition a determinative value, in favor of the\nwitness of Scripture.  The question I want to deal with is, WHAT commandments\ncan we find from our Lord in Scripture?  And that turns out to be a hard\nquestion.  [ If any of my Protestant Inquisitors would *like* to turn the\ndiscussion to the authority of tradition, I can accomodate them :-), unlike\n*most* Protestants, Episcopalians admit claims from a) Scripture b) Reason\nand c) Tradition on roughly equal standing. ]\n\nEarlier in John than my quote above, we read [John 13:34] \"I give you a new \ncommandment: love one another.\"  This is the ONLY place in the NT where\nChristians are given an explicit commandment, with the context commenting\non its imperative mode pronouncement by Jesus.  At the same meal [so we\n*readers* infer, since it is *not* in John, but in the Synoptics] Jesus\nsays, \"Take this [bread]; this is my body.\"  [Mark 14:22, cf. Matthew 26:26,\nLuke 22:19, 1 Corinthians 11:24]  The mode is imperative (Greek _labete_),\nand hence this, too, is a \"commandment.\"\n\nIn *both* cases we have to *infer* that the command is directed to a wider\ncircle than the immediate collocation of disciples -- because we judge the\nevangelist's point in mentioning it (with the disciples by then mostly or\nentirely dead) is that *we* are expected to follow this as a commandment\nfrom our Lord.  In the case of communion, Paul's mention (at least; this\nis probably true of the evangelists also) implies an ongoing ritual liturgy\nin which these words operate to \"bind\" Christians to the original command\nto his disciples, as a continuing commandment to the Christian community.\n\nI am entirely comfortable with this inference, but I *must* point out that\nit is THERE, between us and the occasion on which Jesus spoke the command.\nI take it as a clear inference, at the very least the EVANGELIST'S notion,\nthat *all* Christians are called to love one another, in Jesus' command\ndirected at the disciples.  But I have to call attention to the inference.\nThe command CANNOT apply to me without the generalization from the specific\ncontext of its statement to my own context as a \"disciple\" of Christ.\n\nAll reading of scripture has to make such inferences, to get any sense out\nof the text whatsoever.  This is a general problem in reading these texts\n-- we cannot read them at all without our *own* understanding of our native\nlanguages in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts, and without\n*some* appreciation of the original context (and at points, the original\nlanguages, when English misleads us.) I am going to presume, in what follows,\nthat we have the *general* problem of how to read scripture under control\n[ I don't *really* think this is true, but it will suffice for my current\npurposes. ]  I will address ONLY the issues that arise when we have already\ncoped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world\nthan the one we live in.  Questions at THAT level only introduce MORE reser-\nvations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we\ncan read the texts as the original audience might have done.\n\nAmong the reasons we have for seeing John's _agapate allelou_ as a *general*\ncommandment (not merely an instruction by Jesus to this disciples on that\none occasion), and one linking it to the Synoptic \"Great Commandment\" is\nthat we have criticism, from Jesus, about limiting our love to those whom\nwe congenially associate with.  In Matthew 5:43ff we read, \"You have learnt\nsay to you: love your enemies.\"  In fact, the Leviticus context quoted\ndoes NOT say 'hate your enemy' -- it is merely the common human presumption.\n(And Leviticus is at pains to say that the \"love\" should extend to strangers\namongst the people of Israel.)  Luke, in expanding on this same Q context,\ngoes on to have Jesus say. \"Even sinners love those who love them.\" [6:27]\nAll of this suggests [quite strongly, I'd say :-)] that *limiting* the\nscope of the \"new commandment\" is not quite what Jesus has in mind.  In\nshort, inference *leads me* to generalizing the actual text to a command\nthat is \"in force\" on Christians, and with objects not limited to other\nChristians.\n\nTrickier than the _agapate allelou_ or Institution of communion, there is\nthe case of the \"Great Commission\" where (Matthew 10, Mark 6) the Twelve\nare sent out to evangelize, \"Proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close\nat hand.\"  The verb is imperative (_ke:russete_), but the context is rather\nspecific to the Twelve, and there are further specifiers (as in \"Do not\nturn your steps to pagan territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town\"\n-- the Lukan parallels are even more specific to Jesus' final journey to\nJerusalem) which make it harder to see this generalizing to all Christians\nthan the previous examples.  That hasn't prevented Christians from MAKING\nsuch an inference; what I have to call attention to is that such inference\nis NOT justified in the text, nor (unlike the first two cases I cite) by\nthe rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader.  Still, Paul seems to\nhave felt obliged to \"proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand\"\neven (contrary to Jesus' instructions to the 12 :-)) to the gentiles, to\nthe ends of the earth.  So, Christians after him have also taken this as\na \"commandment\" in the sense of John 14:15.  Do I \"accept\" this?  I don't\nknow.  It is surely rather speculative.  But you see how the ripples of\ninference spread out from the text that is the pretext -- Christians (may)\ninfer a general commandment, applicable to all, from what is presented in\nthe gospels as a specific occasion.  I do not (necessarily) object to this\nkind of generalization -- but I *insist* that people who make it *must*\nhave an understanding that they are *reasoning* (at some considerable\nlength) from what we actually *have* in scripture.  There are *assumptions*\ninvolved in this reasoning, and *these* are *not* themselves scriptural\n(though people will do their best to \"justify\" their assumptions by OTHER\nreferences to scripture -- which simply adds MORE inference into the mix!)\n\nLet's move on to the \"Great Commandment\" -- that we should love God with\nour whole hearts and minds and souls.  This is, perhaps, the Synoptic\n\"equivalent\" of John's _agapate allelou_.  And yet,  it is not PRESENTED\nas a commandment, in our texts.  Rather, the context is controversy with\nthe Pharisees.  To cite Matthew [22:34ff]\n\n\t\"But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees\n\tthey got together and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question,\n\t\"Master, which is the greatest commandment of the Law?\"\n\nIt is by no means obvious here (though I accept it as such) that Jesus'\nanswer is meant to be a commandment *to Christians*.  He is answering a\npolemic from his enemies.  [ Mark's account, in  12:28-34 casts the answer\nin a far more positive light as (so the \"scribe\" in this version says)\n\"far more important than any holocaust (I need to point out that this word\noriginates in the context of animal sacrifice; forget the Nazis for this)\nor sacrifice.\"  Luke is intermediate -- he has a lawyer posing the question\n\"to disconcert\" Jesus, and gets the Good Samarian parable for his pains\n[ Luke 10:25-37 ].  The contexts here are so confusingly various that one\ncould be forgiven for drawing *no* inferences :-)  In *no* account is this\nsaid as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on\nChristians -- though I think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each\ncase that Jesus thinks it to be so.  The point is that our mental gears\nHAVE to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about\nwhat WE are commanded to do, by Jesus.  And all of this is contingent on\nour understanding the point of Jesus' use of the Torah in the (all quite\ndifferent) gospel accounts, and the application of such a context to *us*.\n\nThe different contexts among the Synoptics are curious.  It should be noted\nthat ONLY in Luke do we get the \"fixing\" of this command by the parable of\nthe Good Samaritan.  We may look for an analogous *intent* in Matthew, where\n7:12 gives the \"Golden Rule\" as \"the meaning of the Law and the Prophets\"\n(and where we may also hear an echo of Hillel saying the same, a generation\nbefore Jesus.)  If we make these associations (which I think are entirely\nreasonable), we are -- again -- indulging in inference.  The texts do not\n*explicitly* support us; rather, we *read* the texts as having this kind of\ninter-relationship.  Current literary theory calls this \"intertextuality.\"\n\nMy discussion of why the _agapate allelou_ \"has\" to apply beyond the \ncommunity of the disciples, and beyound the circle of Christian believers,\napplies again here, to buttress a conclusion that this *is* (despite the\npresentation not saying so explicitly) a \"commandment\" to Christians.\nFew Christians would disagree with my conclusions -- but I *must* point\nout that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* on rather elaborate chains\nof reasoning that are simply NOT present in the texts, themselves.\n\nThe contextual problem keeps coming up, more and more severely as we look at\nthose sayings of Jesus that are NOT so universally taken by Christians as \ncommandments.  And we get some really hard cases.  Take divorce.  Mark is \npretty clear, \"The man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty\nof adultery against her.\"  [ 10:11, cf. Luke 16:18 ] -- except that Matthew\nhas an escape clause [ \"except in the case of fornication\", 5:31 ]. This\nseems to be a rather clear \"commandment\" (whether or not we take Matthew's\nreservation); and some Christians, to this day, take it so.  But some don't,\nat least in practice.  This is rather peculiar; it is not as if Jesus were\nnot explicit about this (whereas He says nothing at all about some of the\nthings people gnash their teeth over.)  How is it possible, if the commands\nof Christ are clear, that Matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists\nof the synoptic tradition?\n\nI'm going to continue this examination, into ever-murkier waters, but this\nis enough to start with.  The theme is: \"finding commandments in scripture\nis an exercise in inference; our inferences are informed by OUR assumptions,\nthat is, our own cultural biases.\"  I have, so far, identified a very few\n\"commandments\" that are generally accepted by all Christians -- and yet in\nthese, already, some of the difficulties start to surface.  It is these\ndifficulties I want to discuss in my next essay on this topic.  The divorce\ncommandment already strikes at some of the difficulties: I see almost no\nevidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn\n*me* with, spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc.couples or\nmisc.legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce, or demanding that\nUS law refuse to allow it, or refuse \"unrepentant divorcees\" places in\ntheir churches.  [ That is not to say that divorce *doesn't* enter into \nconsideration in general -- it is most definitely a matter of concern, in\neven the most \"liberal\" church circles.  For example, a (wildly) liberal\nEpiscopalian priest of my aqauintence, in a (wildly) liberal diocese, has\nrecommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a\n\"private\" secular ceremony before a judge, so that the \"public\" ceremony\nhe celebrated need not go through an agonizing \"examination\" by officials\nwho would just as soon NOT take on this role of interpreting the commands\nwe are faced with as Christians.  This, in a church that was effectively\nCREATED by a famous divorce! ]", "label": 19}

{"text": "[deleted]\n[]       And as far as fully-automatic weapons, you can be a lot better\n[]armed if you want to hit what you aim at.\n[]\n\nDefine \"armed better\". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the\nColt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which\nfaster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other\nguys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson\nin hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to\n3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops\nlike to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something\noften in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).\n\nA revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.\n\n- A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull\n  the trigger again.\n- A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,\n  but will fire merely by pulling the trigger.\n- A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again\n  to rotate to the next round.\n- A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the\n  hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an\n  easy motion, even one handed.\n- Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines\n  on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.\n\n- A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell\n  first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often\n  lost as you realize \"hey, it's jammed!\" before starting to do anything\n  about clearing it.\n- Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round\n  and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the \n  chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider\n  this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed\n  of employment as a revolver.\n- There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of\n  operation of many of them requires more training.\n\nSome police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly\nswitching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having\naccidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks\nrequire rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex\nas the timer on a VCR.\n\nAnyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun\nthe police don't know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter\nand pay attention. I do not seek here to say \"semi-autos are junk\"\nmerely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop\nwith a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than\nequipped for anything short of a riot.\n\nGun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a \nwonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit anything.\nGood controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit.\nI own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon\nto something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven't hit\nwhat I'm aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously\nwrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of those\nextra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in\ncriminal encounters is less than 5.\n\nWhat do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple\n.38 revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police \nprefer the much heftier .357 Magnum, but anyway.....\n\nObPlea: Don't flame me, I prefer semi-autos for most things.

I see enough\nbmws and gasoline mercs for sale that have 100-150k miles on them and advertise \nrebuilt engines. If honda was to build an accord for 30k, I'd darn well\nexpect the sucker to last 300k miles.\n\n\nEver got caught behind a early 80's 300SDL at a stop light? It's not\npleasant. The newer MB's are a lot better though. The diesel Volvos\nand VWs are probably the smelliest offenders.\n\nAs for economy, why should we care? Gas is cheap! I personally wouldn't\nbuy a diesel car for any reason - what does it buy me?\n\nShantanu Ganguly\nSomerset (Motorola)", "label": 7}

{"text": "Reply-To: pwhite@empros.com\n \n \nHere in America people tend to think of choosing a church much like they\nthink of choosing a car or a country club. What I mean is that our \nculture is such that we tend towards satisfying our own wants rather\nthan considering things with others in mind and not making prayer \nan initial and primary part of the decision process. People tend to\ntreat church as they would a club and when something is less than to\ntheir liking, off they go to another one.\n\nI think that scripture presents the idea that God takes a different \nperspective on the \"church choosing process\". It seems to me from 1Cor 12\nthat God doesn't subscribe to the idea of us choosing a church at all\nbut that he places us in the body as he wants us. So, I think a better\nquestion is not how do I choose a church but how do I figure out where\nGod is trying to place me.\n\nIf a person was instrumental in leading you to Christ, the church they\ngo to is a logical first choice. You have been born into the family of\nGod. People should hop around from church to church as often as they\nhop from natural family to family.\n\nIf you met the Lord on your own (so to speak) there may not be an \neasily identifiable church to try for starters. Here you are more\nlike an orphan. Prayerfully go and \"leave yourself on a few doorsteps\"\nand see if anyplace feels like home. \n\nI wouldn't expect that God want to place you in a church where you\nhave difficulty fitting in with the people, but on the other hand\nthere are no perfect churches. If you have an attitude of looking\nfor problems you will both find them and make them. On the other hand\nif you have an attitude of love and committment, you will spread that\nwherever you go. \n\nIn general, I think that God will try to place you in a church that\ntalks about the Lord in the way that you have come to know him and is\nexpanding on that base.", "label": 15}

{"text": "\n\n\"Assuming\"? Also: come on, Brad. If we are going to get anywhere in \nthis (or any) discussion, it doesn't help to bring up elements I never \naddressed, *nor commented on in any way*. I made no comment on who is \n\"right\" or who is \"wrong\", only that civilians ARE being used as cover \nand that, having been placed \"in between\" the Israelis and the guerillas,\nthey *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight.\n \n\t[The *purpose* of an army's use of military uniforms \n\tis *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that \n\tcivilians will not be thought of by the other side as\n\t\"combatants\". So, what do you think is the \"meaning behind\", \n\tthe intention and the effect when an \"army\" purposely \n\t*does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look \n\tlike civilians'? *They are judging that the benefit they will \n\treceive from this \"cover\" is more important that the harm\n\tthat will come to civilians.*\n\nThis is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying\nthat the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians\nin \"the middle\" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart\nfrom civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower\nthe risk to civilians.\n\n\tBut if the guerillas do this aren't *they* putting themselves\n\tat greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves \"why set \n\tourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made \n\tcover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of \n\tview, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept \n\tsome of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.\n\n\nI agree with you here. I have always thought that Israel's bombing\nsortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane AND\nineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait \nuntil attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that\n\"taking the fight *to* the enemy\" will do more to stop attacks. \n\nAs I said previously, Israel spent several decades \"sitting passively\"\non its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after*\nthe attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn't work very well.\nThe \"host\" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks \nfrom its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks\nwere considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact \non the civilians caught in their path.  \n\nThis is just another \"selectively applied\" statement.\n \nThe reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelis\nis that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By your\ncriteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.\n\nThat is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for \nthe \"interim\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are\ndemanding conditions that essentially define \"autonomy\" already. They DO\nNOT trust that Israel will \"follow through\" the entire process and allow\nPalestinians to reach full autonomy. \n\nDo you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians? \nIf you do, then why should Israel's view of Arabs/Palestinians \nbe any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians' words?\nSince they don't, they are VERY reluctant to give up \"tangible assets \n(land, control of areas) in exchange for \"words\". For this reason,\nthey are also concerned about the sorts of \"guarantees\" they will have \nthat the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.\n\nAbsolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for the\nIsraelis \"word\" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is being\ndemanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party\nfinally gets HOLD of this \"land\", what the \"other party\" does\nis totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land,\nyour words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses to\nkeeps its word does NOT get the land back.\n\n\nWhile the \"major armaments\" (those allowing people to wage \"civil wars\")\nhave been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still\nremain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and \"commando\"\nraids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard\nfor human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue.\n\n\nBat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks\nwere commonplace.\n\n\nThere is NO WAY these groups can be effectively \"disarmed\" UNLESS the state\nis as authoritarian is Syria's. The only other way is for Lebanon to take\nit upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentially\nmirroring Israel's border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that\nit is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory.\n\nThat's what I said, ok? But, doesn't that mean that Syria has to \"take over\"\nLebanon? I don't think Israel or Lebanon would like that.\nWhat both \"sides\" need is to receive something \"tangible\". The Arabs/\nPalestinians are looking for \"land\" and demanding that they receive it\nprior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if it\ngives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic\nsituation (and that change doesn't help Israel's position), and 2) WHEN\nit gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to\ncompensate for the increased risks", "label": 17}

{"text": "SSF is up for redesign again.  Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n", "label": 14}

{"text": "REFLECTIONS ON BOSNIA\n\nLORD OWEN AND THE SERBS\n\nIn early February '93, Lord Owen made appearances in New York City\non the Donahue and Charlie Rose shows. On a couple of occasions on\nthose shows Lord Owen gave away his pro-Serbian position when he\nmade the point that much or most of the Bosnian territory then in\ndispute or already overrun by Serbian forces had been controlled\nand occupied by Serbs before WWII.  It was as if he were saying\nthat since the Serbs had previously occupied those territories and\nlost them during the Hitler years, they should be allowed to\nreconquer them today.\n\nI was familiar with this view because my father, a Yugoslav Jew\nwho escaped to this country during the war, was aided and found\nsympathy among the Serbs during those harrowing years.  In recent\nmonths when the subject of Serbian aggression was mentioned, my\nfather would make the point that 850,000 Serbs were killed by Nazi\nand pro-Nazi Croatian forces known as the Ustasha.  My father is\nso pro-Serbian that he dismissed reports of Serbian atrocities. My\nfather also excoriated New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis,\nbecause, my father said, Anthony Lewis \"is always talking about\nthe Muslims.\"\n\nUpdate--April 28, 1993 After an uneasy truce in and around\nSbernica, shelling has resumed in nearby areas by all sides and\nthe killing and the misery continues apace while the Clinton\nadministration dithers its response.  In the days leading to the\ncollapse of resistance at Sbernica, Lord Owen changed his tune.\nPreviously he had opposed military intervention on the grounds\nthat it would endanger U.N. relief workers. When Serbian forces\nbegan to march on Sbernica, the threat to U.N. relief soldiers\nwent unmentioned while Lord Owen called for outside intervention\nto stop Serbian aggression, including the use of air strikes.  The\ncurrent disastrous situation can be seen as a failure of the West\nand a failure of the Vance-Owen initiative which did nothing to\nhalt the Serbs. Now that it's too late to save Muslim areas that\nLord Owen felt should be in a Muslim state, Lord Owen belatedly\ncalls for strong action.\n\nCLINTON AND BOSNIA\n\nIn the summer of 1992, George Kenney, a senior State Department\nofficial, the undersecretary in charge of the Yugoslav desk, made\nnews when he resigned from the State Department because of the\nBush administration's refusal to take any action to halt Serbian\naggression.  As Kenney saw it, Bush's inaction was largely due to\nthe president's unwillingness to risk any political capital by\ngetting involved there.\n\nApparently the same is true of the Clinton administration.\nClinton gives the impression that he cares more than Bush did\nabout the terrible ongoing tragedy, but the practical effect has\nso far been the same.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, (4/16/93) the Clinton\nadministration did everything it could to suppress a mid-March\nreport by its own experts which called for military action if\nnecessary to protect \"safe havens\" for the Muslims. At one point,\nSenate majority leader, George Mitchell was so incensed that the\nreport was kept from Congress, that he called for an\ninvestigation.\n\nInstead of helping the desperate Bosnians, Clinton has signalled\nagain and again that Milosevic and the Serbs are free to do what\nthey want in Bosnia--indeed, Clinton and the West have been\nsignalling that the Serbs should get on with the job and finish\noff the Bosnians as quickly as possible while we turn the other\nway.  A key signal was when Clinton made it clear that he would\nNOT send in American military forces on the ground.  On this\nissue, Clinton has made me wistful for Bush.  Bush and Baker could\nnot have done worse, and might have been pressured to do better\nwell before this time.  Lives in Bosnia might have been saved and\nthe destruction might have been curtailed..\n\nThe Nation, the left and \"the Bosnian QUANDARY\"\n\nTypical of the left's inability to come to grips with the core\nissue involved in Bosnia, i.e., a clear aggressor destroying\nhundreds of thousands of lives, is the editorial on the \"Bosnian\nquandary\" in The Nation (4/26/93).  In the end the editorial votes\nto do nothing, even while noticing \"the ghastly atrocities of the\nBosnian Serbs\"  and that the \"greater and lesser powers...dither\nand fuss [and] hang back.\" (\"Before anything else happens, the\nClinton Administration ought to pay the $530 million the United\nStates owes the\" U.N. the editorial concludes.)\n\nIn its most striking passage, the editorial writer warns that\n\"those who are pushing President Clinton to intervene on the side\nof the Bosnians had better review U.S. foreign policy since World\nWar II.\"  The editorial argues for inaction on the basis that the\nBosnian Serbs are no worse than any number of U.S. clients\nincluding the Chileans, the South Africans, the Greek fascists and\nothers. (In a subsequent column for The Nation, Christopher\nHitchens correctly called this editorial, \"contemptible.\")\n\n***\n\nWilliam Pfaff, a European based journalist who writes for the The\nNew Yorker and the Los Angeles Times, is among a group of liberal\ncolumnists like Anthony Lewis, and Leslie Gelb who have clearly\nand consistently called for strong Western and American\nintervention to stop the Serbs.  Pfaff's most recent column\n(Liberal Opinion Week 4/19/93) is entitled \"International\nCowardice Worsened Bosnian Tragedy.\"\n\nHe clarifies the international failure which has led to present\nsituation in one sentence. \"Having refused to intervene to\nsanction the threat to minority rights in newly independent\nCroatia in June 1991, or to block or penalize the military\naggression by Serbia that immediately followed, and the atrocious\n\"ethnic cleansing\" which followed that, the United Nations now\ncontemplates deploying in Bosnia military force on a scale which\ntwo years ago could have deterred the horrors Yugoslavia has since\nexperienced.\"  He goes on to explain that U.N. plans now envisaged\ncall for a \"more daunting and open-ended military assignment than\na direct military intervention to halt the aggression would have\nbeen a year ago.\"\n\nAryeh Neier on the Serbs In his \"Watching Rights\" column in the\nThe Nation (5/3/93) Aryeh Neier gets to the heart of the\nmotivation of the \"aggressors\"--the preferred term for the Serbian\nforces who have been besieging and shelling Sarajevo for more than\na year.  He explains that \"there is no  military purpose that is\nserved by the destruction of its fabric and its people...Above\nall, few of those aligned with the forces attacking Sarajevo would\nwant to live there even if the city could be rebuilt.  They are\nnot city people.\n\n\"It is this, I believe--aside from a desire to break the morale of\nBosnians and make them press their government to accept peace at\nany price--that explains the conduct of the siege of\nSarajevo...[I]t is a loathing for all that is urban, pluralist and\ncosmopolitan that has made Sarajevo the object for devastation.\n\n\"Historically, most of the Serbian population in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina has been rural, while Muslims, who were the civil\nservants and intelligentsia during the centuries of Ottoman rule,\nmade up a disproportionate share of the urban population....The\ndestruction of Sarajevo is not only an expression of hostility\nagainst this city; it is also an attack on the urban idea....The\ndemagogues who whipped up the passions let loose by this war\nexploited not only ethnic and religious bigotry but also hatred\nfor all that is cosmopolitan.\"\n\nThe light that Neier sheds on the issue helps to clarify what is\nat stake.  The Serbs represent the know-nothing, anti-secularist,\nfundamentalist, fascist forces who are attacking the urban,\ncosmopolitan, secular, multi-cultural idea.  They are attacking\nthe rest of us, just as Hitler did. One irony is that at the\nbeginning of the crisis over Bosnia, it was for awhile maintained\nby the Serbs and their supporters that they were responding to a\nthreat by the Bosnian Muslims to create a fundamentalist state.\n\nNeier has shown that it is the Serbs who are  the great threat to\nsecularism, multi-culturalism, diversity and democracy.  It's the\nSerbs who are attacking the democratic notion, the democratic\nidea.\n\nAnthony Lewis comes close to the point when he asks why does\nrespect for Clinton's presidency \"depend...on his acting\neffectively against Serbian aggression?...First of all because to\ndo nothing about genocide would be such a betrayal of the values\nwe and our allies profess.\"  (Times, 4/26/93) But it's not merely\na betrayal of our values.  It's because the Serbs are attacking us\nby proxy, just as Hitler was.\n\nOne argument for decisive action by the West that is heard in a\ndifferent form, is that war in the Balkans is destablizing for\nEurope.  We hear it as, the Bosnians are Europe's Palestinians;\nthat is to say, just as the Palestinian refugee problem has been\nthe key to instability in the Middle East, just so will the\nhundreds of thousands of Yugoslav refugees of all ethnicities\nresult in turmoil in Europe for decades to come.\n\nOne of the lessons of the twentieth century is that even though\nthe Atlantic Ocean divides us, the Americas are ultimately tied to\nthe destiny of Europe. If Europe is destabilized, the U.S. will\ninevitably be affected and drawn into its problems.  As in a\nwhirlpool,  sooner or later we will be drawn into the maelstrom.\nAnd as past history and Pfaff have shown, it's much better if we\ndo so decisively, quickly and on our terms.", "label": 17}

Taken out of context, words can be interpreted much\ndifferently than had one applied them within the confines of\ntheir original expression.\n\nI think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior \nof the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bit\nfrom Merlinus X' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes\nto which Order members have been known to go in their fervor.\nI have little knowledge regarding Reuss' background, but surely\nhe was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order \nfor many years.\n\nYet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back\nso carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is\nonly the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed\nwhich extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there\nwas and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order\nitself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.\n\n\nLet us examine this issue a bit more closely....\n\n\"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist\nand paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo\nTempli Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he\nmet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  \nKellner's efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz\nHartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together\nprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902\nin Reuss's Masonic publication, 'Oriflamme'.  On Kellner's death,\nReuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The 'Jubilee' edition of\nthe 'Oriflamme', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught\nsecret of sexual magic.\n \n\"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in\nAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and\npossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist\nLeague founded by Karl Marx's daughter and her husband.  Reuss was\nlater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden\nDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to\nfound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several\nattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the\ndevelopment of the O.T.O.\n\n\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss' leadership.\nFor example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin\nand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between\nReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and\naccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,\nthe initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for\nthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all\nthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked\nwhen publishing the material of the Equinox.\n\n\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a\nstroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when\n_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break\nin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.\nover the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.\nHe had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss's request, deeply\ninfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\"\n\n_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX'\n\nWithin _Equinox III:10_, Edited by \n  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,\n    Caliph of the United States of America,\n      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.\n\n\n\nThere are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this\nmaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?\nWhy did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own\norganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle\nof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very\ncomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room\nfor very many interpretations.\n\nIt is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived\nout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters\nwith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I\ncan take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble\nsupport of the 'Law of Thelema' is laughable at best.\n\nWould I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  \nWill I?  \nI think not.\nWhy?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection\nI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things\nin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be\nquite difficult to apprehend at first.\n\nSo it may be with OTO and Merlinus X'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.\nI do not support Reuss's words myself, as I am not qualified to assess\nthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of\nthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then\nwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that\nthe Order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or\ndoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of\nuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic\nrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?\n\n\nI find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.\nThey are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane\nor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  \nHaving met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or\nwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity\nof the organization as it stands.\n\nI have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments \nI followed my intuition, and I've found little to stop me from requesting\na Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I'm happily participating\nin social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic\nMass well enough for my tastes.\n \n\nThis doesn't make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.\nI can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my\nlimited contact with other members.\n\nI urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many\nways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with\nthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom\nand the preservation of individual vision.\n\nI welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response\nto other posts in this thread.\n\n\nInvoke me under my stars.

In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen\nand the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR \"full\" height. \nThe screen would probably be monochrome.\nThe motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very\npopular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word\nprocessing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient\nto see a large portion of the document.

{"text": "Review of 1989 Ford Taurus SHO -- By Gene Kim\n=============================================\n\nBackground:\n\n    Last week, I bought a 1989 Ford Taurus SHO, moving up from driving\na 1987 Toyota Celica ST and a 1975 Oldsmobile Cutlass.  I have been\ninterested in buying a SHO for about five months and have been combing\nthe classifieds in Denver and Chicago every week.  I bought a\nremarkably clean maroon/red SHO with 92K miles on it for $6800.\nAs far as I can tell, this is about $2000 under Blue Book and I still\nhave another 8000 miles before the Extended Service Plan runs out.\n\n    As one should with any pre-1991 SHOs, I made sure that the car was\nalready refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate, as well as\nhaving been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments.\nHowever, my SHO does not have the newer rod shifter -- I understand I\ncan get this for $230 from any Ford service center.  In addition, the\ncar received the full tune-up at 60K miles, receiving new platinum\nplugs and valve adjustment.\n\n    For a car with 92K miles on it, the car was virtually immaculate.\nThe clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents,\nalthough the front air-dam/molding was covered with lots of small\nscratches -- not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the\nhighway.\n\n    Having driven a smaller two-door coupe for so long, I was a bit\nconcerned about whether I could get used to driving a larger car.  To\nmy surprise, the size of the car doesn't bother me at all -- it seems\njust as nimble as my Celica!  (No comparisons with my Oldsmobile.  :-)\nVisibility from the driver's seat is excellent, helped mostly by of\nthe small the quarter-windows, aft of the back-seat door windows and\nin front of the C-pillar and rear window.  Parallel parking is a bit\nmore difficult, but other than that, I love the size.\n\n    In fact, I'm starting to appreciate the large trunk as I pack up\nfor a 14-hour drive to Washington, DC for the summer.  More on the\nride later in this review.\n\n\nEngine:\n    \n    As with anyone even slightly interested in SHOs, I was very\ninterested in the 24-valve 3.0L Yamaha \"Shogun\" engine.  I was not\ndisappointed.  Base performance of the engine under 4000 rpms is\ngood.  You can even do reasonable launches from second gear, although\nI don't make a practice of this.  The engine revs smoothly and eagerly\n-- tooling around town does not require many shifts.  This is good\nsince the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car.\n(More on this later.)\n\n    While the performance of the engine under 4000 rpms may be\nunremarkable, it undergoes a Jekyll/Hyde transformation once you hit\nhigher revs.  At 4500 rpms, a butterfly valve opens and you can\nliterally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve\nmore valves open up.  The engine soars to its 7000 rpm redline, and\nyou are treated to, in my opinion, the sweetest sounding V6 around.\nThe engine inexplicably sounds OVERJOYED to be at 6500 rpm!\n\n    I've noticed that when I drive around town, I constantly watch the\ntach to see how far below 4000 rpm I am.  To go from 2000 rpm to 4000,\nyou may have to punch the accelerator -- while torque is more than\nadequate, it doesn't come fully online until those other 12 valves\nare used.\n\n\nTransmission:\n\n    When _Car and Driver_ first reviewed the car in 1988, they\nmarvelled at how Ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter\ninto the car.  I remember driving a friend's parent's SHO in 1990, and\nremember thinking about whether I had the leg strength to drive the\ncar in traffic -- the clutch was that stiff.  That was back then.\n\n    The entire clutch assembly on my SHO has been replaced under a\nFord recall in 1991.  The clutch on the SHO feels no stiffer than the\none on my Toyota Celica.  In fact, the friction point seems a bit\nlarger and more forgiving.\n\n    When playing with the shifter with the car parked, the shifter\nfelt very reasonable.  The 1-2 and 3-4 gates were where you'd expect\nit to be, and the shifting action was smooth.  On the road, it's\nmuch the same -- but you have to shift SLOWLY!  Make no mistake, it's\na clumsy shifter.\n\n    When hurrying shifts, like when I was initially trying to impress\nfriends, I consistently miss the 1-2 shift, often grope clumsily for\nthe 2-3 shift, and sometimes even muff the 3-4 shift.  I find this\npretty amazing in a car like this.\n\n    It also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest\nshifts when you take your time.  Seems obvious, but compared to my\nToyota and my friend's Honda, this seems atrocious and clumsy.\nSomeone on rec.autos noted that CRXs should blow SHOs off-the-line\nbecause of the incredibly clumsy shifter.\n\n    I now shift much more sedately, and the shifter seems more\nreasonable.  When you play within these bounds, the shifter works\nsmoothly with no surprises.  I don't know whether the rod shifter\nupgrade would help at all.\n\n    Along these same lines, I initially had trouble shifting gears\nsmoothly.  Again, slowing down the shifts and taking more care to\nmatch revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely.  This took\nseveral days for me to get the hang of.  (I think some of my problems\nwere because I've never had a car with enough power to balk at bad\nshifts in higher gears.)\n\n    Occasionally, I have trouble shifting into reverse.  The shifter\nrefuses to enter the gate, and I often grind the synchros trying to \nget it into gear.  I'll be watching this carefully in the next couple\nof months.\n\n    A quirk:  When I upshift and the engine drops back to 1000-2500\nrpm, I hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the\nengine compartment.  Not terribly loud, but the passenger can\ndefinitely hear it.  I asked about it when I was looking at the car,\nas do all my passengers.  Apparently, this is a definitely a \"SHO\nsound\" and is the gearbox -- apparently called \"gear rollover\".\nReplies to my queries on rec.autos are at the end of this review.\n\n\nExterior:\n\n    As I mentioned before, I am astounded by how well the body of this\nSHO has stood up.  Paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are\nvirtually non-existent.  Looking at how older Tauri sometimes\ndon't age so gracefully, I wonder what the guys at Ford did\ndifferently to the SHO bodies.\n\n    The body, in my opinion, is extremely attractive with matching\ncolor body moldings than the stock Tauri.  For some odd reason, the\nSHO seems different enough from vanilla Tauri to get stares at\nstoplights -- of course, this could be my overactive imagination.\n:-)  SHOs get fog lights, a more open grille, a completely\nmonochromatic exterior, and a deeper ground skirt in the back with\n\"SHO\" stenciled in relief.  I've seen a couple SHOs whose owners have\ncolored these in with florescent colors or in black.  Yuck.\n\n    I don't think the car is flashy.  I like it that way.  I feel\nalmost anonymous with all those Tauri out there, but different and\ndistinctive enough to those of us who care.  :-)\n\n\nInterior:\n\n    The interior is what really makes me feel like I don't deserve the\ncar.  The seats are grey leather, the steering wheel and shifter are\ncovered with black leather, and the entire instrument panel is done in\na black/grey/metallic scheme.  \n\n    The instrumentation is stock Taurus, except for the 140 mph speedo\nand 8000 rpm tach.  You get a center console with two cupholders, a\nlarge compartment under the radio (great for a CD player), an armrest\nthat contains yet another compartment, three appropriately sized coin\nholders for tollways (I think), and a compartment for holding\ncassette tapes.  There's map-holders in the doors, and an oddly small\nglove compartment.\n\n    I spilled a whole can of Coke in the cupholder and was delighted\nto find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a\nsink.  Hey, I'm really impressed with the ergonomics and\nthoughtfulness that went into its design.  And it's a 1989, before the\ninterior was upgraded!\n\n    The backseat is bigger than any car I've had.  Why do they need so\nmuch space?  :-)  (No smart-ass comments, please.  :-)\n\n    The driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters.  From\nwhat I hear, it's not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear.\nMine is no exception.  The left side bolster on the driver's has\ncracked and I'm not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the\nway.\n\n    A big surprise for me:  I forgot that SHOs don't have a normal\nhand parking brake.  Instead, they have the regular parking brake that\nyou press with your left foot.  Too bad.  Again, I'm getting used to\nit, but it seems a bit anachronistic to me.\n\n\nRide:\n\n    The suspension is nice and stiff.  Too stiff?  It's stiffer than\nany car I've had.  A friend's new 1993 Toyota Celica ST seems tauter\nand is still able to soak up bumps better.  The SHO seems stiffer with\nless ability to soak up bumps.  Driving over railroad tracks is a\nnoisy and jarring affair.  On the other hand, taking turns feels\nwonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn't flex at all -- I\nlistened for that before I bought the car.\n\n    On the highway, the ride is great.  When I drove the car from\nChicago back to Purdue, I had trouble keeping under 85 mph, let alone\nfrom trying to see what 100 mph really feels like.  It's a relatively\nquiet ride, but the sunroof rattles.  I've tried to find out what\nexactly makes all the noise up there, but it seems to be the window\nthat rests on the rails.  No easy way to get rid of it, I think.\n\n    Over the past three days, I've oscillated between thinking the\nsuspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way\ntoo rough.  (Not for me, mind you.  But I wonder whether I would\nadvise my dad to buy one for himself.)  But, I've discovered, as with\nthe shifter, if you take your time with shifts, you'll have no reason\nto complain.  Let me explain...\n\n    The ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the\nwheels.  I feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer\nmaking the car skitter left and right.  After I understood this, I\navoid the limits of traction -- and I'm a happy camper again.\n\n    It's not body rigidity, but the composure of the car.\n\n    As if matching the suspension, the steering feel is quite heavy.\nMy first impression of driving my SHO was how hard you had to turn the\nwheel at highway speeds.  It tracks straight as an arrow, but when\ndriving around a parking lot, the high-effort steering didn't seem so\nuseful.  However, it's reasonable, but it doesn't communicate the road\nto the driver as well as a 1993 Ford Probe GT.  IMHO, it's much better\nthan the steering on my Celica ST.\n\n    I wonder how bad this car is during winter?\n\n\nMiscellaneous notes:\n\n    GRIPES:\n\n    The rattles from the sunroof is intermittent -- some days it rattles\n        loudly, other days I look up wondering where all the noise went.\n\n    Activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy -- loud squealing as\n\tit retracts on its rails.  I wonder if there is a quick fix for this.\n\tAgain, other days it completely disappears.  (Function of humidity?)\n\n    Once I made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension\n\tand torque steer, I've never complained about ride.\n\n    I wish the seats had more support under the thighs.  Also, I wish the\n\tside bolsters would close more tightly.  \n\n    I hear that tires for this car can get really expensive.  I\n\tcurrently have Goodyear GT+4s that cost the previous owner $500\n\tfor four.\n\n    I used to hate the Ford stereo systems -- whose idea was it\n\tto use a volume *paddle*?  Now, to my amazement, I don't\n\treally mind...  and sometimes think it's an okay idea!!!\n\tPretty ridiculous, though.\n\n    Getting up to 4000 rpm sometimes seems to be a chore.  But,\n\tthis is no big deal.  There is more than enough torque\n\tdown low.\n\n    I often goof up the shifting when driving with friends.  It\n\ttook me a couple of days before I could really shift\n\tsmoothly from 2nd to 3rd gear.  (Hard to believe, isn't it?)\n\n    My car has almost 93,000 miles on it.  My parents noted that\n\tit is almost impossible to find a low-mileage SHO. \n\tAstute observation, IMHO.  I wonder how long I can make\n\tmy SHO last -- I just bought a book titled \"Drive It Forever\"\n\tfor tips in this department.  :-)\n\n    The goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop.  I once\n\tparked the car in gear, and then accidentally let out the clutch\n\tafter I started it.  The car jolted forward, and bounced off\n\tthe car in front of me -- no paint damage at all, but starting the car \n\tis a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal!  Also, I began \n\tto wonder how strong that brake really is.  (Today, I backed out of \n\tparking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed \n\tthe glowing brake light.  Oops.)\n\n    The driver's power window creaks when closed all the way.  The same\n    \tthing happens in my parents 1989 Mercury Sable.  Oddly, all the\n\tother windows work smoothly.\n\n\n    LIKES:\n\n    I'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day.  The\n    \tcupholders are great.\n\n    I didn't expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much, but\n\tit really is handy.  You can lock all the doors by\n\tpressing the 7/8 and 9/10 buttons together!  Neat!  And\n\tyou can never lock yourself out of the car.\n\n    I really feel like I don't deserve this car.  I really can't\n\tbelieve that I could afford it.  I got this car ten years \n\tahead of schedule.  :-)\n\n    I love this car so much that I've been telling my parents to\n\tlook into buying one.  I love this car so much that I\n\twrote this 13K file -- I meant to write a couple of lines\n\tand ended up with this.  \n\n    If there were a J.D. Powers Survey for used car owners, I would have\n\tan opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this \n\tcar.  I don't like thinking about getting another car, but at this\n\tpoint in time, I'm sure I'd buy another SHO.  For under $7000, you\n\tcan't beat it.  (Next time with an airbag and ABS, though.)\n\n    Insurance-wise, this car is also a big win.  I pay the same premiums\n\tas on my 1987 Toyota Celica -- despite that it has nearly twice\n\tthe horsepower.  \n\n\n\nOther Odds and Ends:\n\n    Much to my amazement, there is no SHO mailing list anywhere.\nMaybe because the _SHO Registry_ publication has filled this void.  I\nhaven't joined yet, but I've noticed that queries about SHOs still\nappear on rec.autos about once a month.  Owners of SHOs are always\nquick to respond, and are very vocal fans of the cars.  (Maybe some\nof the most vocal on rec.autos.  :-)\n\n    I've put together the responses to my questions about the cars, as\nwell as other posts with useful information on these cars.  I'll be \nposting this in the form of a FAQ soon.  \n\n    If anyone is interested in starting a mailing list, please speak up!\nI don't know if I have the resources here at Purdue to start one, but \nmaybe someone out there does.\n", "label": 7}

{"text": "This discussion on \"objective\" seems to be falling into solipsism (Eg: the\nrecent challenge from Frank Dwyer, for someone to prove that he can actually\nobserve phenomena).  Someones even made the statement that science is\n\"subjective\" and that even atom are \"subjective.\" This is getting a bit silly\nand the word \"objective\" is losing all meaning.  Lets start by remembering the\ndefinition of \"objective\" which has been already presented:\n\n  objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as \n    distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existence.\n    3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on\n    observable phenomenon.\n\nThe Objectivity of a thing is not based on whether everyone agrees on that\nthing (eg: the world is objectively round, regardless of the fact that there\nexist flat earthers), but rather whether it is based observable and verifiable\nphenomenon (instead of being based solely on peoples wishes, feeling, mental\nprocesses, etc).  Thus atoms, being based on very observable and repeatable\nphenomenon, are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective. \nEven weird, high energy physics is based on observable phenomenon (even though\nthat observation can change the outcome).  Nor are those observable phenomenon\naffected by emotion, or personal prejudice (eg: chemical reactions do not\nchange to the whims of different people).  Thus to say that science is not\nobjective (ie: objectively verifiable) is a bit silly, as that is the\npoint of science.  Now I will agree that science is not objectively \"good;\" I\nwill not thereby conclude though that science is not objective. \n\nNow some examples things which are \"objective\":  A D-12 tractor is larger\nthan the average breadbox.  Chlorophyll is green.  Seawater contains salt.\nThere exists ozone in the atmosphere (at least presently).  Ozone blocks \nultraviolet light.  Ultraviolet light increases the incidents of skin Cancer.\n\n\"Good\" on the other hand is a value judgement.  It doesn't seem to have an\nexistence apart from what we give it (unless someone can objectively show the\nexistence of an omnipotent entity which has defined \"good\").  We cannot\nquantify it, touch it or collect it in any concrete sense (eg: I have a bag\nfull of \"good\").  Now we do sometimes attempt to give the word \"good\" an\nobjective meaning, e.g.  \"good\" has been used to denote strength, resiliency,\nspeed, etc.  That though, is a subjective definition, as some might not see\n\"strength\" and etc, as necessarily \"good\" (eg: strength inspired by Naziism \nis not generally viewed as \"good\"). \n\nAs to a morality, I cannot say that I have ever seen a morality strictly based\non verifiable observable phenomenon.  The closest I have seen is some form of\nthe \"Golden Rule,\" which concludes that it is best not to deliberately piss\npeople off, as they will likely then involve themselves in your life, in a\nmanner you won't like.  This is verifiable; when you \"get in someone's face,\"\nthey will often retaliate.  Another objective fact about morality is that a\nmore powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group, and thus can\nat times, ignore that form of the \"Golden Rule\" without fear of reprisal.  Now\nas to whether this enforcing of morality is \"good\" or \"bad,\" is quite\nsubjective.  By the way, remember that subjective does not mean that a thing\ncannot be formally stated, or even commonly agreed upon; it only means that\nthat it is not verifiable from observable phenomena, or has a physical\nexistence unto itself.  Also note that I have not stated that there is no such\nthing as an objective morality, or that I could not accept any such a\nmorality; I have simply stated that I have seen no evidence of any such\nmorality. \n\nOne other thing to notice, \"objective\" is many times used as synonymous with\n\"true\" and/or \"absolute,\" and \"subjective\" sometimes has the connotation of\n\"false\" and/or \"relative.\" Tain't necessarily so.  For instance, when a\nconclusion is based on objective, but insufficient evidence, then it can be\nboth objective and false.  As to \"absolute,\" it is easy to note that while we\ncan objectively show that TNT is explosive, but that does not absolutely mean\nthat all TNT will explode, and thus objective is not necessarily absolute\neither.  On the other hand, something subjective can also be either\n\"absolutist,\" or \"true.\" For instance, there are some theists who are\nspecifically \"absolutist\" in their morality, even though they have only\nsubjective evidence to back it up.  Further, many a scientist and detective\nhas been motivated by subjective reasons (eg: a \"gut feeling\" or \"hunch\"), to\ninvestigate a phenomena or situation, and gather the objective evidence\nnecessary to support a true hypothesis.  On the whole though, I would have to\nagree that objective evidence is much more trustworthy than subjective\nevidence.\n \n\t\t\t\tLater,\n\n\t\t\t\tDave Butler", "label": 19}

{"text": "\nYes, that's exactly what I felt.  My heart just felt that what I was\nbeing taught was *wrong* -- a basically good message, but framed in\nerrors.  I could not with a clear conscience accept that women were\nsomehow not equal to men, that homosexuals are \"guilty\" of their\nlifestyle, that pride in one's work is a bad thing, that Jesus died\nfor me -- I don't want ANYBODY to die for me, especially as an\nimpersonal act where the person can't possibly even *know* me well\nenough to really know if I'm worth dying for or not.\n\nI was never able to accept the bit about Jesus's death being a good\nthing.  If that means that I'm just not comprehending a basic message\nof Christianity, then so be it.  Maybe I'm just not compatible with\nChristianity.  I just refuse to follow rules blindly, and since I\ncan't even convince myself that your god even EXISTS in the way you\ndescribe it, I've got to just follow my own conscience in these matters.\n\n\nDon't think that my morals are shoddy or nonexistent just because I\ndon't believe in your god.  I will not steal, and I will not murder --\nnot because I fear divine repudiation, but because these just *aren't*\nin my character.  You may think there's nothing keeping me from just\nrunning around on a murdering spree, stealing things when I'm able,\ninsulting people for the heck of it, because I'm not answerable to\nanyone; but you'd be wrong.  I'm answerable to myself.  A life like\nthat would be a cheap life; I happen to want to earn respect in myself.\n\n\nMy initial break with Christianity came after a lot of soul-searching\nand a lot of wondering why I could no longer feel the 'presence' of\nGod with me.  I finally decided that I had once \"felt\" this presence\njust as I had \"felt\" my mighty teddy bear beside me when I was a\nlittle tyke, protecting me from the monsters under the bed -- that I\nhad believed in God just as I had believed in the teddy bear, as\nsomething of an emotional crutch to protect me from perceived dangers.\n\nSince then, I've never abandoned the possibility that maybe your\nsupernatural trinity does exist.  But there are a few times when, in\nmy darkened room by my bed, I have set aside everything I believe for\na moment and called out to whatever's out there, because I want to\nknow the truth even if it means abandoning everything I know.  And I\nhave not yet received an answer.\n\n\nNope.  It may well be unknowable.  Scientists have suggested that the\nuniverse may be finite and wrap around on itself (the three-dimensional\nuniverse may be mapped onto a four-dimensional supersphere in the same\nway you can map a two-dimensional plane onto a three-dimensional\nsphere; see _Sphereland_, the sequel to _Flatland_, for more thoughts\non this).  Our entire universe might just be an electron in a four-\ndimensional universe, which in turn may only be an insignificant speck\nin a universe above that, and so on and so forth until the variables\nbecome too much for us to even speculate on.\n\nThat is, there's no possible way for us to know exactly how we came to\nbe, so there's no reason at all to believe that your God exists nor\nhad anything to do with it.\n\n\nChristians have provided me with nothing except quotes from your holy\nbook, and all sorts of tactics to try to get me to believe: guilt\ntrips, insinuations that I'm without morals, arguments from disbelief\n(\"how can you possibly believe that God *doesn't* exist?\"), and so\nforth.  All I'm asking is for you to convince me.  I want to be convinced,\nbut it's not going to be easy.\n\n\nHaving had years upon years of contact with your religion from both\nthe inside and the outside, I view it as harmful in many ways.  It\npreys on people who want to find meaning in their lives, and once it's\ngot these people, it teaches them to have pity (and sometimes starkly\nintolerant) of others who do not share these views.  Maybe you'll say\nthat your religion doesn't teach that -- but I've got to judge\nChristianity from the Christians I know.\n\nI feel that it is entirely possible and good to have faith in one's\nself, and to be a positive influence on society for no better reason\nthan that.\n\nSo I hope that my words in this newsgroup will at least make some\npeople think.  I want Christians to realize that there are perfectly\nvalid lifestyles and opinions that have nothing to do with their deity\nwhatsoever, and I want people who are considering Christianity to\nrealize that Christianity does not hold the sole key to a happy,\nfulfilled life.\n\nI have known some very nice Christians who have done some very nice\nthings.  I think what sets these people apart from the general masses\nis that they recognize that their religious beliefs may be wrong, and\nthey know the weaknesses of their religion, yet they still decide to\nbelieve, but they keep their beliefs to themselves and do not think\nany less of people who don't agree with them.\n\n\nPrecisely my point.  You've still not given me a reason to be a\nChristian instead of a Buddhist or a Moslem...\n\n\n... just as the Moslems aren't religious, and the Buddhists aren't\nreligious.

All present Macs support the use of \n32-bit color through 32-bit color QuickDraw in ROM.  32-bit color QuickDraw \nallows an almost transparent capability to display and edit X-bit images in Y-\nbit color and retain ALL the colors of Y-bit color [Where X and Y \nindependently are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32] regardless of monitor resolution {63 \ndpi [12\" color] to 94 dpi [PaletteBook]} or monitor type {including \nautosynchronous VGA, MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including 66.7 hz \nvertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor (MacUser \nAug 1992: 158-176).  Older machines that supported color {SE/30, II, IIX, and \nIIcx} had only 8-bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32-bit \ncolor (MacUser Special 1993:28-29).  \nTo keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display \ncapability built-in, but most of those can be expanded to display 24-bit \ncolor.    Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display; QuickDraw QX \nwill change this.\nIn addition, QuickDraw allows, in Macs with a NuBus slot, more then one \nmonitor to be used in any combination, from two monitors showing the same \nthing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree \nof overlap of the pictures.\nVRAM: Video RAM.  Standard for present non-PowerBook Mac's handling of \n built-in video {from a 32-bit color palette}. VRAM provided runs a 8-bit\n color 640x480 display; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display. \nSound output:  Standard in all Macs since the 128K.  Stereo sound became \n standard with the SE/30.\n\nIBM:  Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system \ninteracts with the video hardware (Nan Zou), the use of drivers bypassing \nBIOS, video hareware inconsitancies {see Super VGA below} and nonstanderzation\nof clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware, OS and program \ninteraction up to the OS and video hardware in question (Faisal Nameer \nJawdat). In addition, IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a \nstandard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is \nactually present (Matt Healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like \nMac's QD}. As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes, \nespecially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {At present \nthings are so dependent on the interaction of the program, OS, print driver \nand monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, OS, \nand monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with \nan IBM.  For example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2 \n486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA {18-bit color palette} and DOS 5.0 \nand still have ALL the colors one started out with}.\nLater IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster \nprocessors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, CD \nROM, and Ethernet (PC Week 12/14/92).  \nMDA: Monocrome Display Adapter\n original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text.\nCGA: Color Graphics Array\n 320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes.\nEGA:  Enhanced Graphics Array\n 640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions \n could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes.\nVGA:  Video Graphics Array*\n 320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are \n the most commonly used.  All modes have a 256K CLUT, from a \n 18 to 24-bit {IBM} or a 32-bit {Mac} color palette.  25.175 MHz Pixel Clock\n (Mel Martinez).  Monitors use analog input, incompatible with TTL signals\n from EGA/CGA etc. \nMCGA:  Multi-Color Graphics Array*\n subset of VGA that provides all the features of MDA & CGA, but lacks some EGA \n and VGA modes, like VGA 640x480x16 (Dictionary of Computer Terms-DCT).  \n Common on the initial PS/1 implementation from IBM and some PS/2 Models.\nSVGA:  Super VGA*\n This is not a standard in the way the others were, but instead was a 'catch \n all' category for a group of video cards.  As such, with each manufacturer \n using their own implementation scheme, SVGA was chaos with people debating\n as to what is SVGA and what is not.  In an effort to make SVGA more of a \n standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units, but things\n are still a mess.  Video is either 512K [~1990] or 1M [today], resolution\n of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since \n 1990] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600, \n some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually \n at 640x480].  Speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [Western Digital \n Paradise based, for example], some very fast [S3 86C911 based, for example], \n some are so-so [like Tseng ET4000, a very popular chipset].  Some limiting \n factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus & 386's linear address mapping were: \n 8.33 MHz ISA bus, AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a \n 64K \"window\", etc.\nOther non-SVGA standards: \n8514/a:\n IBM's own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions \n like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. Some clone implementations \n from ATI are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do \n not have interlacing. \nTMS34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually >$1000, some\n do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like CAD.\nXGA:  eXtended Graphics Array\n newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for MCA bus-based PS/2s, clones \n are coming out soon.  Emulates VGA, EGA, and CGA (DCT).  Max resolution at \n 1024x768x8b, same as 8514/a, also some 16 bpp modes.\nXGA-2\n Accelerates graphics functions up to 20 times faster than standard VGA in\n Windows and OS/2, including line draws, bit and pixel-block transfers, area\n fills, masking and X/Y addressing. Has an intelligent way to detect and co-\n exist with other XGA-2 cards, so multiple desktops like on the Mac may not be \n far away.  Since this is an architecture, its resolution and color depth \n isn't fixed {IBM implements only 16-bit [65,536] color, while other \n companies can have 24-bit color through IBM technical licenses}. Refresh \n rates up to 75 Hz, ensures flicker free, rock solid images to reduce visual \n discomfort, and is VGA compatible. Up to 1280x1024 on OS/2.\n*some monitor types usable by Mac-See Mac section above for specific details.\n\nExpansion\nBoth Mac & IBM\nSCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.\n Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card \n expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  \n Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal \n terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port \n {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the \n end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. \nSCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}\n and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  Difference is due to SCSI-1 software\n drivers.  \"Fast SCSI-1\" is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode\n {see SCSI-2 for details}.\nSCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully\n SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast\n SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in  \n hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do.  Transfer speeds are\n 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and\n 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can\n use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such\n is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called \"fast SCSI-1\". \n 16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics\n but can still use the SCSI-1 ports.  Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a\n different SCSI port, electronics, and software driver from SCSI-1 {Which\n makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}.\nMac SCSI: asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus.  Even though \n Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers, the OS SCSI Manager\n needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI\n interfaces.  As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast \n asynchronous SCSI-1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2\n controller chip built-in (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)) \n though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide SCSI-2 port \n interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2, older NuBus \n Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor-some\n Cyclone Macs {June} will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard \n and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager.\nIBM SCSI:  SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with \n systems, except as add-on {EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable}.\n Like the Mac, 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers\n out there.  Unlike the Mac, IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications\n which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI.\n\nMac\nMemory expansion: with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin \n 8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs\n could be used in these Macs, only special IIcis could make use of the parity \n feature {By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs}.  The IIfx \n used 64-pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III, C610/650 and Q800 all use a new \n 72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs.\n The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every\n memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will\n not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is.\n Since Macs made before Feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, SIMMs \n had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  The Centris \n 650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that \n allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same \n size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two SIMMs resulting \n in a 10-15% performance boost on RAM access (MacWorld Apr 93: 108-109).\nPrinters, ADBs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard.\nMonitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs. \nPDS: Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs. 16-bit {SE, \n Portable, LC, LC II, Classic line} and 32-bit.  Operates at CPU's MHz.  \n Maximum through put: data path in bytes*CPU's MHz {Q700/900 & C650: \n 4 * 25Mhz = 100MB/s; Q800 & Q950: 4 * 33Mhz = 132MB/s}. Standardized with\n the LC and 040 bus designs.  With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in \n IIsi and C610.  Problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows \n through put down.\nNuBus Mac II: 32-bit, 10 MHz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio,\n and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s; theoretical peak:\n 40MB/s.  Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series, C610, and \n Performa 400.  The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a \n Mac Plus SCSI NuBus.  Supports every possible expansion from CPU to Ethernet \n to DMA.\nNuBus 90: NuBus Mac II back compatable. 20MHz bus clock, avg throughput:\n ~30MB/s; burst mode: 80MB/s.  Future card designs will be 7\" instead of the \n old 12\".\nQuickRing:  A peer-to-peer bus used in parallel with NuBus 90.  Apple's \n VLBus - \"Architecture is identical to that of VLBus\" (Byte 10/92:128).\n Burst mode: 350MB/s (Byte 10/92:128). In development.\nCPU expansion: handled either through the PDS or the NuBus.  Unlike PDS,  \n Nubus CPU cards {example-Radius Rocket} allow use of multiple processors at \n the same time.  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to \n dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {Each \n NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with \n 8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard}.\n\nIBM\nMemory expansion:  parity SIMMs, non-parity SIMMs {some newer models do a Mac-\nlike SIMM memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards.\n\nHD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: \nMFM:  Modified Frequency Modulation, RLL:  Run Length Limited\n only used with smaller [Â² 60mb] hard drives.\nIDE:  Integrated Device Electronics \n Asynchronous {~5MB/s max} and synchronous {8.3MB/s max} transfer.\n currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized \n drives. Can have more than one hard drive. \nESDI:  Enhanced Small Device Interface\n ~1.25MB/s throughput. generally considered better interface than SCSI-1 in\n many ways but not common enough for practical consideration.  Outside of\n hard drives, device choices are very limited compared to SCSI-1. \n\nBUS interfaces\n{New 'plug and play' ISA and EISA compatable cards may have problems working \nwith old cards (InfoWorld; PC Week 03/08/93; Vaporware 4/93).}\nISA\n 8 & 16-bit interfaces common. Has 24-bit data path limit {which produces a\n 16MB limit for which there are software workarounds} (PC Mag 4/27/93:105).\n 1.5 MB/s (Byte 3/93:132).  Uses edge-triggered interrupts, can't share them,\n hence comes the IRQ conflict.  Limited busmastering capabilities, some cards\n aren't bandwidth limited {COM  ports, LPT ports, game ports, MIDI card, etc.}\n while others are {video and disk controllers}.  Dominant factor, but it's\n showing its age.  Most ISA motherboard designs are 16-bit\n (PC World Feb 1993: 144-5)}.  \nMCA {Micro Channel}\n IBM's 16 and 32-bit bus; \"allows use of more than one CPU in a computer\" \n (DCT) and anything can talk to anything, as fast as the two components \n involved can handle it. Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA \n and EISA.  Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 (Carl Jabido).\nEISA {NuBus Mac II is closest Mac equivalent}\n 32-bit, 8.33 MHz, burst mode: 33MB/s.  It also has the ability to \n self-configure cards like MCA and allows multiple bus masters, sharable \n interrupt and DMA channels and multiple CPU use.\nVESA Local Bus: VLB {Sometimes mistakenly refereed to as PDS}\n Local Bus standard. Runs at CPU clock rate,  Burst modes: ~130 MB/s{32-bit}\n 250 MB/s{64-bit} (Byte 10/92:128).  Limited to three slots but allows bus \n mastering and will coexist with either ISA or EISA. Consitered ideal for \n video and disk I/O.  DELL has filled a claim that this violates one of\n their patents (Mel Martinez).\nQuickRing: Apple's faster {350 MB/s burst} version of VLB architecture\n (Byte 10/92:132).  Might show up in some IBM and PowerPC machines\n (Byte 10/92:132-133). In development.\nPCI\n Intel's version of Local Bus that is intended to totally replace \n ISA/EISA/MCA.  In development.\n\nOSes {assumes full installation [print drivers, fonts, Multifinder, etc.]\nand multiple application use.}\nMac\n512K to 1MB of OS and hardware commands have been put into ROM.  This allows \nApple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS {QuickDraw, \nmenu commands, print, mouse, SCSI & sound drivers, etc} in ROM, which require \nclone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks {Which requires \naccess to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM \nchips; Plus vs Classic for example.}  With key hooks for the OS support \ninterface in ROM, programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS \nhas the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and \ntherefore can write smaller programs.  This also allows Apple greater control \nover hardware-software standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and, with \nsome of the tookbox command code in ROM, with lower RAM requirements then a \ntotally disk based OS.  Macs use Masked ROM which is as fast as DRAM (Jon \nWtte).\n6.0.7: Single program usage base requirements: 1 MB and DD floppy, \n cooperatively-multitasking base requirements: 2MB and HD floppy.  \n Features a GUI, cooperative-multitasker [MultiFinder], standard program \n interface, & standard stereo sound support [snd]. Network receiving part of \n AppleShare software is bundled with the OS. Has a 8MB RAM barrier and is a \n 24-bit OS. Some third party products allow 14MB of Virtual Memory as long as \n real RAM is below 8MB.\n6.0.8: 6.0.7 with 7.0.0 print drivers.\n6.0.8L:  System 6 for some Macs that require System 7.0.X.\n7.0.X: Base requirements: 2MB, 40MB Hard Drive, and 68000; De-facto standard \n to run all features well: 4MB, 80MB Hard Drive, and 68030 {lowest present \n non-portable Mac configuration}.  Using up to 10.08MB {This is EVERYTHING on\n system disks} of hard disk space this has 6.0.7 features plus program linking \n within and between computers [IAC], built-in server capabilities {Filesharing \n can be used by older OSes using AppleShare Client software and can be \n accessed by 10 macs max; 4-5 is more speed practical, IAC requires 7.X}, \n Virtual Memory in machines with MMU{1.6 times real RAM for least noticeable \n IIsi speed degradation}, drag and drop, QuickTime & built-in TrueType \n support.  Supports sound input [AIFF and snd formats] for most present \n machines.  Can access up to 1GB of true RAM and 4GB of virtual memory and is \n both a 24 and 32-bit OS.  To use real RAM beyond 8MB it must be in 32-bit \n mode and on older machines requires the 'Mode 32' extension.  Apple's last \n 'free' OS.\n7.1.0: 7.0.1 with WorldScript support, speedier, and less RAM usage than \n 7.0.dot (MacWeek 8/24/92; 9/14/92; PC Week 9/7/92). To run in 32-bit mode \n on older machines it requires the 'Mode 32' or '32-Bit Enabler' extension. \n Marks the start of Apple saling its Mac OS instead of allowing free upgrades\n {Bundled with new machines, $49 for 7.0.X upgrades, $99 otherwise}.\n [The installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system \n fonts from the previous system inside the system file.  This can eat up any \n RAM benefits and cause other problems.  Apple itself recommends removing all \n fonts from the system file.]\nA/UX 3.0 [UNIX]: Needs 8MB RAM {12-20MB suggested}, 160MB hard drive, and \n a 68030 or 68040 equivalent to run.  This 32-bit preemptive multitasking OS \n is large due to being UNIX and needing translators between it and the Mac \n ROMs.  Price: $709.\nNote: sound output was supported in OSes 3.2 to 6.0.5 by many formats \nincluding the following:  snd, WAVE, ASND, FSSD, QSSN, SMSD, SOUN, dc2d, and \nDCFL.  In 6.0.7 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards 'snd' \nand AIFF which causes some playback problems for the old formats, though most \nstill play.\n\nIBM\n Machiness have little GUI code, data, and hooks present in hardware for \nprogrammers to work with, so most of the coding must be provided in the OS.  \nSince hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM.  In addition, \nwhat little ROM code there is also read into RAM {a process called Shadow ROM}  \nThis results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or \nEPROMS.  Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to \nbetter optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which \nis harder with a ROM based system due to the 'patches' needed.  In addition it \nreduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware \nsupport is needed.\nSide note:  The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing \nall feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing \nits Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS/2 (\"Undocumented Windows\") and \n\"There is deliberate code in [Windows] NT Beta which causes the install to \nabort if OS/2 Boot Manager is present\" (Gregory Hicks, Info-IBMPC Digest V92 \n#201).  Due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the FTC \njudicial council for action against Microsoft was a tie which resulted in no \naction.  Rumors-the FTC will presue the matter, likely to the point of \nchoosing a new member or whole new council.  In addition the government has \nturned down Microsoft's copyright of \"Windows\" which would allow it to charge \na fee for developers using their hooks (PC Week 03/08/93).\nMicroSoft OSes\nDOS 5.0: Has a 640K barrier with its own memory manager, a 1 MB barrier \n with third party memory managers.  This 16-bit OS requires that each program \n must provide its own print drivers and be 16-bit {Programs need to be DOS \n Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) compliant and running on a 386dx [32-bit \n Protected Mode] to break these barriers}.  Contains the GUI shell present in\n DOS 4.0.\nDOS 6.0: DOS 5.0 with the added features of a built-in file compresion, disk \n defragmenter, debugger for the CONFIG.SYS file. It needs a $80 module for \n networking {Cost: $50 through 5/93, after that $129.99} \n (Byte April 1993:44-46).\nDOS 7.0: 32-bit DOS. In development (PC Week 04/05/93).\nWindow 3.0: Runs on top of DOS.  Breaks 640K and 1M barriers but still has to \n deal with DOS file structure.  Base requirements: 1MB, floppy and 286; to\n run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx and fast display adapter {> 8-bit}.  Has the\n equivalent of Mac's QD called Windows GDI [Graphics Device Interface].\n This does not have a consistent application interface {Like early Mac\n programs  (1984-1985)} nor a very large program base {compared to DOS} and\n still tends to slow the machine down (Info-IBMPC Digest V92 #186) with speed\n is more dependent on the display adapter then on the CPU (Bill Coleman).\n Window programs tend to be disk and memory hogs compared to their DOS\n counterparts (Byte April 1993:98-108).\nWindow 3.1: A faster version of Window 3.0 with better memory managment. Base \n requirements 1 MB, hard drive and a 286 ;to run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx. \n Apple plans to release its print drivers for this (PC Week 12/28/92).\nWindows for Workgroups:  To run well: 4MB RAM and 386dx (PC World Feb/93:160).  \n Intermediary between Win 3.1 and Windows NT.  It is basically Windows 3.1 \n with built-in peer to peer networking support.\nWindows NT:  Beta release takes about 50MB of disk space [including the \n swap file], and 12MB RAM {Betas are notorious for RAM usage especially in \n the interaction between debuging code and program compliers, hence the \n reports of 24MB requirements}.  Released version supposed to need 8MB RAM \n but, Gates himself now recommends 16MB RAM (PC Week 04/15/92).\n This 32-bit OS has Protected mode multitasking, multithreading, symmetric \n multiprocessing, a recoverable file system, and 32-bit GDI.  Has built in\n networking that is OSF DCE compliant and can handle up to 4GB of RAM.  Even\n though some people see a July 4 release date (InfoWorld Nov 16/92), rumor\n is that the final version will not be available before Oct 1993\n (InfoWorld May 25/92; July 6/92; Vaporware 07/92; 08/92) or 4th quarter 1993\n (PC Week 09/28/92). Windows upgrades will be $295, otherwise $495\n (PC Week 04/15/92; 03/15/93).\nOther OSes\nPC-DOS 6.0: IBM's version of DOS 6.0.  It runs Windows much faster then DOS \n 6.0 due to faster file I/O and video handling (InfoWorld Feb 1, 93).\nDR DOS 6.0: same as DOS 5.0 with some extras {like built-in data compression} \n and memory management enhancements. Still has 640K/1MB barrier.  A later \n version {Novell DOS} of this may use a version of the Mac finder and Apple \n file management system (PC Week 12/14/92; InfoWorld Dec 14/92).\nOS/2 2.0: Unix like features and unix like requirements; 8-16MB RAM,\n 60MB {uses 17-33MB} hard drive, and 386dx CPU. This 32-bit multithreaded, \n multitasking OS can address up to 4GB of RAM but has to use a fast swap file \n to use more than 16 MB RAM on ISA systems using DMA {Direct Memory Access}. \n IBM plans to use Taligent's OOPS in future versions of this \n (InfoWorld Oct 26/92).\nAIX:  IBM's UNIX system, planned to be a subset of PowerOpen and Taligent OS.\nNeXTStep: GUI UNIX to provide NeXT features on IBM machines.  Beta out, final \n version to be out by May 25, 1993.\nSolaris OS for x86: a SunSoft port.  A 32-bit OS with symmetric \n multiprocessing and multithreading, built-in networking capabilities with \n tools to allow remote configuring and adminstration features, and \n communication package.

Developer kits-software: $495, hardware: $195.\nMac 7.1 [working name: Star Trek]:  Apple had System 7.0 running off Intel \n Chips and is looking at making a 7.1 version available for IBM \n (ComputerWorld Nov 2/92; MacWeek 03/22/93). At present this is planned to run \n on top of Novell's DR DOS, require a 486 or equivalent to run and that apps \n will need to be recompiled (MacWeek 03/22/93).  Viewed as Novell's answer to \n Windows NT.  The complexity of PC hardware set ups is one reason for slow \n progress {This seems to Apple/IBM's way of leading to the PowerPC line out in \n late 1993/early 1994 and Pink OS in late 1994-early 1995.}\n\nPowerPC\nRumor-IBM will build its PowerPC 601 by late 1993 (InfoWorld June 8 & 15, 92; \nMacWeek 7/13/92; PC Week 3/15/93).  It will have MicroChannel bus and XGA \nvideo (Carl B Jabido), and will run native version AIX and Mac apps (PC Week \n3/15/93); there have been no comments on compatablity of DOS or Windows apps.\nApple's PowerPC 601 machine {Tesseract} is planned to be out Jan 24, 1994 and \nto have MC98601/50 MHz, 4/8MB RAM, a 2.8-Mbyte floppy drive and expected to \nsale near LC line prices {~$2000, down from projections of ~$3000 (MacUser \n9/92:146)}\n(MacWeek 3/22/93).\nPowerOpen [A/UX 4.0]: A 32-bit preemtive multitasking OS planned to run on\n PowerPCs and 68030/40 Macs (MacWeek 7/13/92).  Intel compatibility uncertain\n (See Mac 7.1 above).  Planned base requirements:  68030, 8MB RAM, 80MB hard\n drive (MacWeek 4/19/93). Rumor-ahead of schedule; COULD be out by mid 1993.\n Rumor-this could be the OS for IBM's PowerPC 601 which is due by late 1993.\nPink [Taligent OS]: Expecting delivery in 1994 (Wall Street Journal 1/12/92) \n and may have some parts shipping in OS/2 and AIX in 1993 and Mac OS and \n PowerOpen with the PowerPCs (MacWeek 01/25/93).\nWindows NT: Possible port (MacWeek 04/05/93).  See IBM OS section for details.\nSolaris OS: Version of this Sun Microsystems Inc UNIX OS to run on the\n Power PCs in 1994 (MacWeek 04/05/93).  One of the few OSes to directly state \n that it will run Windows/DOS programs.  IBM OS section for details\nNeXTStep: possible port see IBM OS section for details.\n\nOS Number Crunching (Mel Park)\nMac\n Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment {SANE or Standard \nApple Numerics Environment}. Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an \nFPU is present and 80 bits otherwise. Exceptions, such as dividing by zero or \ntaking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are \nhandled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal \nrepresentation for infinity (INF).  1/(1/0) produces zero. The above treatment \nof 1/(1/0) occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and \nthe FPU programmed directly.\n\nIBM\n Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU, 64-bits when \nemulated.  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever \ncompiler or assembler was used for a program. On older DOS complilers \nexceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the DOS \nprompt at the point where they occured.  Most present compilers handle this \nbetter.  Result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS, \nWindows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS.\n\nNetworking [Includes printing]\nWYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially \nif one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer.\nMac\nHardware: Built-in LocalTalk network port and a built-in printer port.  \nLocalTalk has moderate speeds (230.4 Kb/s) requires special connectors for \neach machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to \ninclude very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  Built-in \nEthernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at \nabout $150-$300 for each machine.  These cards provide three connectors and \ntransceivers {thick, thin, and 10BaseT} for Ethernet.\nThe Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet \ninterface on motherboard, with transceivers available. TokenRing has been a \nnetwork option since 1989.\nSoftware: AppleTalk {the suite of protocols} standard with Mac OS, which can \nuse variety of media types.  AppleShare client software included with the OS \nas well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware, 3Com 3+Open, \nBanyan Vines, DEC Pathworks, Apple's AppleShare servers, System 7 File Sharing \nmachines, and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts.  MacTCP allows \ntypical TCP/IP communications (telnet, ftp, NFS, rlogin).  A later version \nwill have Unix X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) built-in by the end of 1993 \n(MacWeek 04/12/93).  Third-party software to connect to NFS servers.  DEC \nPathworks provides DECnet support.  Peer-to-peer file sharing software \nbuilt-in to System 7.1 (See OS section).  Full server software is extra. \nPrinting requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in \nthe chooser.  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the \nchooser.  The same is true of connecting to servers.\nPrinting bugs:  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font.\n {QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.}\n\nIBM  \nHardware: LocalTalk [not widely used], Ethernet,  and TokenRing.\nSoftware: Novell Netware, Banyan Vines, DECNet, Windows/Work Groups, AppleTalk \nprotocols, and AppleShare {subset of AppleTalk}.\nEach of the MS-DOS networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible \nwith the others. Once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to \nthat product line from then on.  Windows/Work Groups is a little more \nforgiving and removes some of this problem.  Novell Netware is the biggest, \n{~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and \noffers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it's also more \ncomplex to set up and manage.  This will change due to the use of the Mac \nfinder and file management system by Novell. (PC Week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92;  \nInfoWorld Dec 14/92; MacWeek 3/22/93)\nPrinting {Very OS dependent}\nDOS: If it's a single user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port, \n and don't worry about it {Tweeking may be needed with poorly written \n software}.  Network Printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly \n implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one \n software program to the next.\nWindows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing \"jobs\" \n in the print queue, but it always lists printers as \"active\"... even if they \n are not.  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers \n on the same net, because there's no way for software to reliably determine \n which printer is active right now.  Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like \n and intelligent about this.\nOS/2: Mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the OS.\nPrinting bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do \nnot have WYSIWYG printing.  This is the fault of the programs in question and \nnot that of the OS involved.\n\nPrice issue: This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build-in features \nthan IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need' then Mac and price wars \nby both worlds.\nThe IBM machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware \nstandarization, which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to \nhandle ALL the variation in hardware.  When one adds all the standard Mac \nhardware features to an IBM {built-in input/output sound support, SCSI, PDS,  \nbuilt-in monitor support, built-in networking, standard mouse interface, and \nNuBus 90 in higher machines} the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent \nequipted IBM machine {Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs \nwhich cuts some more of the Mac's cost (MacUser Aug 1992:158-176)}.\n Some prices using some of the info in this sheet and MacUser April 1993.\nAll Macs below come with a PDS slot, VRAM, and SCSI-1 built in.

{"text": "\nI have had my Probe looked at twice by my local dealer (where I purchased\nthe car) ... the first time, they made this problem worse.  The second time,\nafter advising them of the service bulletin mentioned on my ford-probe mailing\nlist (they said they didn't know of the bulletin), they adjusted the window and\nmade it *much* better.  However it now makes a \"scritch scritch\" noise on rough\nroads, and *still* squeals when I open/close the window in wet weather (anyone\nelses's do this?)\n\n\nI got two keys with my car, but only ONE remote-entry push-button thingie!\nBut then, I bought my 93 with 2500 miles, and  I think it may have been a\nrepossession ... so I'm not surprised something was missing :-(\n\n\nI am seriously considering following the advice in the owners manual where\nit describes the procedure to follow if \"you discover something on your Ford\nthat could ... cause ... serious injury ... threaten lives ... etc).  Something\nabout notifying the National Traffic Safety group as well as Ford.  Those little\n\"you've-got-to-position-the-fingers-perfectly-to-make-it-beep\" buttons are\nTERRIBLE.\n\nWell, I guess that's good in a way, but in a way it's bad.  When someone\nhears that kind of horn, they expect to see a big American car.  They may\nnot associate the sound with a small \"jap car\" style car (like the Probe is).\n\n\nThe mudflaps help a lot.\n\n\nI have always been a 5-speed guy.  Almost every car I've ever owned has been\na 5-speed.  Because I got a good deal on this car with the 2500 miles, I\n(knowingly) overlooked the fact that it has an automatic.  But it is a pretty\nhigh-tech automatic.  It is a fully electronicaly controlled 4-speed with\ntorque converter lockup.  Even with the automatic, I'm getting 35 mpg on the\nhighway, driving 65-70!.    (but of course driving > 65 is illegal, so I \nprobably made that sentence up).  :-)     Around town the mileage has been\naround 25-27, not bad for an automatic.   Of course it doesn't have the\n\"control\" of a 5-speed, but since I do a lot of city driving, it turns out\nto be very convenient.  It's nice to be able to drink a cup of coffee and\ndrive at the same time (although that, too, is illegal here in \n\"we-like-to-control-your-life Massachusetts\" :-)\n\n\n\nShakes and rattles has been my main gripe.  I've gotten them to fix the\nworst of them, but I fear that with the rather harsh ride, the car will\nbe a virtual potpouri of rattles when it gets older.\n\n\nOn my 89 Probe GL, I got about 40K out of the original Goodyears,\nand had driven the replacement tires (Bridgestone) 50K miles when\nI tradeed the car.  The 195/65(60?)VR14 Firestones on my 93 Probe\nlook like they're designed for performance (ie rather wide, shallow\ntread, etc), so they probably won't last as long.  But the car handles\nvery very very well.  It sticks to the road like glue, even on a rough\nsurface.\n\n\nDefinitely.  Ford/Mazda did a very very nice job on this one.  The\ncar has a \"much more expensive than it actually is\" look and feel to it.\n\n\nHaving driven an 89 Probe for 4 years, I find the 93 suspension \"interesting\".\nThe car actually drives much better than the 89 ... it is a very firm\nride, and you definitely know about each and every bump in the road.  Yet\nthe car remains very civilized on even the bumpiest roads.  You Hear and\nfeel the bumps, yet the car retains its posture very well.\n\n\nWell I wouldn't encourage passenger-carrying in the Probe unless the\nperson in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the dash.  As\nmentioned in the Consumer Reports write-ups, \"consider the back seat\nas a parcel shelf\".  No biggie to me though (if it had been, I'd not\nhave bought the car!  (but it's definitely not a family car)).\n\n\nA/C is a MUST on any Probe from 89 - 93.  The 93 in particular sends out\na REAL BLAST of cool air when the AC is on MAX.  That \"lots of glass\" you\nmentioned is what gives the car the \"very good visibility\" reports you\nsee in all the write-ups.  Most \"sports/sporty\" cars don't have that\ngood visibility.\n\n\nThe complaints I've heard re: exhaust system (on 93's) have been on \nthe GT.  Of course being a different engine, that is a differeent \nexhaust system.\n\nI was one of those with an 89 who qualified for the free replacement.\nSince I had already replaced the muffler when I received the notice, \nI was/am due a refund from Ford.  I applied in February and am Still\nwaiting.   :-(\n\n\nYes.  I was pretty amazed when I had my car in for some touch-up\nadjustments this past week, and they had to keep it overnight (too busy\nfor them to get to it) and they offered to pay for a rental).  They \ndid make me pay for taxes and insurance though :-(\n\n\nI have to agree that they seem to have some QC problesm.  But I seriously\nfeel the car design is sound, and expect it to do very well.\n", "label": 7}

{"text": "\n\nI'm not quite sure how these numbers are generated.  It appears that in\na neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two\nhome runs).  Or do they?  What is \"equivalent average?\"\n\nOne thing, when looking at Bo's stats, is that you can see that KC took\naway some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for\ndoubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you\nexpect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed, \nhit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his\nvalue to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.  \n\n\nFelix Jose has been a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park.\nI would offhand guess the `89-`90 Bo at around a .330/.530 player.\nMaybe .330/.550 .  Not even close.\n\n\nI'd put him about there too.  \n\nNote: I hadn't realized the media had hyped him so much.  I thought he\nwas always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so \nat baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn't\nwinning.\n\nNote 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a\nmistake being made (by the SDCN's, as they are known, on this group)\nwith respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).\n\nWe find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major\nand minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.\nTheir are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;\nthe lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent\nthe player has left college ball, etc.\n\nNow of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of \"error.\"  Sometimes\na player with poor MLE's (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.\nSome hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don't (Oddibe\nMcDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are\nreal reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)\ninvolve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting\nand so on.\n\nBut still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.\nOne of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background\nof the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is\nthat all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing\nball.  Their backgrounds are similar.\n\nWhat hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a player\nwith a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a\nBo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so\non, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard\nassumptions fit this person slowly?\n\nIt hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with two-sport players.\n(It hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, after\nall, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually\nmake completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.\n\"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,\" they say.  Well,\nwhat happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean?\nIt might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than\nTuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in\nAtlanta than Greenville.  \n\nThen again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank\nthis year, live up to those poor MLE's.  But you guys DON'T KNOW.  What's \nworse, you don't know that you don't.  And you don't know that there are \nother players you won't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties \nagain.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.

{"text": "\nNo smiley on the part about atheism, I see. Do you realize that your\nstatement says that I was mentioning \"nonsense\" about atheism? This is\nhard for me to defend against if this is the claim you are making, as you\nhave only included the last two sentences of my post and mentioned the\nfirst. Please address the substance of my post rather than rejecting it\nout of hand. \nBut, because of the sometimes ambiguous nature of English, I may be\nmisinterpreting your wording here. Please clarify: did you or did you not\nmean to call my statements about atheism \"nonsense\"? If so, care to back\nup that claim?\n\n\nOK, then. Start up the amatuer psycology again. How am I \"broken\"?\n\n\n*YAWN* Excuse me, I don't recall any portion of my post in which I called\nChristians arrogant quote me, if I did. I do remember calling Christianity\n\"silly\" and then following that up with information that I was nine years\nold when I thought that. I also said that I find faith to be intellectually\ndishonest and I would like to see some sort of proof of your god's\nexistence. I define \"faith\" as \"belief in the absense of any proof\", BTW.\n\nAlso, I subscribe to a.a as I mentioned and we see fundies of all types\nthere, so in answer to your question: \"no.\"\n\nFinally, I'd hardly call Christianity \"beseiged\" in this country. I seldom\nsee Christians ridiculed for merely practising their religion or wearing\ncrosses or having Christian bumper stickers. I don't know for sure, of\ncourse, I only say I haven't seen it happening. What I have seen happening\nis my homosexual and/or friends being beat up, or preached at by people\nwho claim to be Christ's followers. I know that this sort of thing isn't\npracticed by the majority of Christians, but it is a very vocal minority\nwho are doing it and I don't see comperable victimization of Christians. \n\n\nThe implication being that I am not self-respecting, of course. I'm not a\nstudent of psychology, BTW, but I am a student of Creative Writing and\nLinguistics, so literary analysis _is_ my forte. Also, if the implications\nI see are improper, please let me know.\nI'm here because I'm not sequestered in my own little atheist cubbyhole as\nyou seem to think atheists should be. Did it occur to you that I _don't_\nthink I know everything and that maybe someone will say something that\nwill change my life? Have you read my other posts here or did you see\n\"atheist\" and decide it was time to poke at someone who doesn't deserve\nyour respect?\nAw, geez. I'm sorry, I probably am getting my back up a little too high,\nhere. It's just that the \"nonsense\" thing really annoys me. I figure you\nshould see my first reactions, though, since they are my true reactions to\nyour question.\nNow, the smoothed feather version:\nI seek all sorts of knowledge. That's why I came to my university. Yes, I\nam looking at your religion (well, sorta, I have no idea what *kind* of\nChristian you are) from the outside, and hopefully with an objective view.\nI've been trying to ask reasoned questions here, because I genuinely don't\nknow the answers to them, but when I saw the question directed at atheists\nI figured I would answer. After all, you can speculate about atheist\nmotives here all you want (hence the \"amatuer\" psychology crack), but\nwithout an atheist, you can't be sure of even one atheist's motive.       \nI'm hoping people really\nwant to know and I was trying to show that I actually checked out several\nreligions and I actually read all the pamphlets people have to offer and I\nactually think about these things. Instead, I'm still faced with the\nimplication that atheism is some kind of aberration and that only \"broken\"\npeople are atheist.\n\tTry it from the flip side: I posit that atheism is the natural\nstate and only broken people are theists. I offer as proof that so many\npeople witness from horrible lives which picked up as soon as they \ndiscovered their religion, that religion is regional (if people didn't\nfollow the religion of their areas, there would be a more homogenous\nmix), so many terrorists claim theistic motives, and that theists tend\nto be so pushy and angry when challenged on alt.atheism. Why are religions\nso successful? Because there is so much suffering in the world, which \n\"breaks\" people.\nIt's an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it, which is another\nreason I'm here, to try to see the flip side of my thinking (and also as \na watchdog for logical fallacies :).\n                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nThe implication here being that atheists can't possibly know anything\nabout Christianity. Probably jumping at shadows again, but I think my\nreaction is somewhat justified. After all, the first post suggested that\natheists are \"broken\", hostile people. This post confirms that someone\nelse believes it. \n\n                                             ^^^^^^^^^^\n\nWell, he got me there. I am a strong atheist, because I feel that lack of\nevidence, especially about something like an omnipotent being, implies\nlack of existence. However, I haven't met the strong atheist yet who said\nthat nothing could ever persuade him. Call me a \"seeker\" if you like, I\ndon't. \n_Weak_ atheism is being ignore here, though. Some atheists simply say \"I\ndon't believe in any god\" rather than my position: \"I believe that no\ngod(s) exist.\" For the weak atheist, the is no atheism to disbelieve,\nbecause they don't actively believe in atheism. (If you think this is\nconfusing, try figuring out the difference between Protestants and\nMethodists from an atheist point of view :).\nThis is another fallacy many theists seem to have, that everyone believes in\nsomething (followed up by \"everyone has faith in something\"). Guess what?\nMy atheism ends the moment I'm shown a proof of some god's existence. Is\nthat really too much to ask?\n\n\n\nWell, I guess you won't succeed in converting him or me. Why the\nsupposition that you will fail to convince him? (amatuer psycology on) Is\nit because you yourself are unconvinced? :) \n\nAnd I told you that I find faith to be intellectually dishonest. Note that\nI can only speak for myself. If you find faith to be honest, show me how.\nI have been unable to reconcile it so far. Maybe that's how I'm \"broken\"?\nI tell you that I have invisible fairies living in my garden and that\nyou should just take my word for it. If you accept that, you are of a\nfundamentally different mind than I and I really would like to know how you\nthink. All I ask for is proof of the assertion \"God exists\". Logical or\nphysical proofs only, please. Then we'll discuss the nature of \"God\".\n\nPrayer?! Uh, oh, we'll have to revoke his atheist club card and beanie! :)\n\n\nGood luck to you, as well.

{"text": "I would like to share with netters a few points I picked up from the PBS\n    Frontline program regarding Iran's nuclear activities, aired on Tuesday\n    April 13. For the sake of brevity, I'll present them in some separate\n    points.\n\n    1- As many other western programs, this program was laid on a bed of\n    misinformation throughout the program, to maximize the effect of the\n    program on the viewer. Some of the misinformations were as follows:\n\n    - It was alleged that:\" Late Imam Khomeini objected to Shah's technological\n    advancements as anti-Islamic, but now things have changed and the proof of\n    change is that some Iranian merchants are now selling personal computers. \"!\n    These are the most ridiculous lies, one can make about the objectives \n    of the Islamic Revolution in toppling the Shah and state of the technology\n    in Iran after revolution.\n\n    -Iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against Iraqi aggressors\n    while there has never been any proof in this regard, and nobody has seen\n    Iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by Iranian chemical weapons, in\n    contrary to what the whole world has seen about Iranian soldiers and\n    civilians, injured by Iraqi chemical weapons.\n\n    - While the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against Iraqi\n    aggression has been officially announced to be about 117,000 and even most\n    radical counter-revolutionary groups claim that Iran and Iraq had a total\n    of one million dead, this program claims that Iran alone has one million\n    dead left from the war.\n\n    - The translation of Iranian officials' talks are not 100% true. For\n    example when Iranian head of Atomic Energy says that: \" It hurts me to\n    see that Iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda.\" The \n    research.\"!\n\n    2- Almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought\n    by Iranians were of countless dual usage, while the program tries to \n    undermine their non-military uses, without any reference to Iran's\n    big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in\n    near future and its current deficit in electrical power.\n\n    3- The whole program is trying to show the Sharif University of \n    Technology as a nuclear research center, while even the cameramen of the\n    program know well that in a country like Iran without a so tightly closed\n    society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university! Taking in account\n    the scientific advancement of Sharif U. in engineering fields and its\n    potential role in improvement of Iran's industries and eventually the\n    lives of people, it is obvious that they are persuading other countries\n    to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones\n    in scientific and industrial efforts.\n\n    4- A key point in program's justifications is trying to disvalidate as\n    much as possible all efforts done by IAEA [*] in their numerous visits from\n    Iran's different sites. They say: \"We are not sure if the places visited\n    by IAEA are the real ones or not\" !, or \" We can not rely on IAEA's\n    reports and observation, because they failed to see Iraq's nuclear\n    activities before\" as if they didn't know that Iraq was trying to build\n    nuclear weapons!\n\n    5- As an extremely personal opinion, the most disgusting aspect of the\n    program was the arrogance of the member of US Senate foreign Affairs,\n    William Triplet, in his way of talking, as if he was the god talking\n    from the absolute knowledge!\n\n       I hope all Iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their\n    country in western media, and I hope Iranian authorities continue to\n    their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs\n    and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations.\n\n\nMohammad\n", "label": 17}

Because  we prevented\nGreece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before European\ncountries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legal\nrights.\"\n\nOn Turco-Greek relations, he pointed  out that both countries are\npredestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historical\nreasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreign\npowers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  by\ncooperating, adding  that in  Turkey he  observed that  there was\nwill to improve relations with Greece.\n\nNEWSPOT, January 1993\n\n\nMACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.\n\nTwo ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in\nAthens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a\nCourt Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.\n\n  Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis)\nhave been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in\nan Athenian magazine.\n\n  Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly\nmagazine  \"ENA\"  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  as\nMacedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would\nfield  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek\ngeneral election.\n\n  Bulev said in the interview: \"I am not Greek, I am Macedonian.\"\nSideropoulos said  in the  article that \"Greece  should recognise\nMacedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations\nagainst  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the\nborder, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC\nare falling.\"\n\n  The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court\nsummons,  was   that  \"they  have   spread...intentionally  false\ninformation  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the\ncitizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the\ninternational interests of the country (Greece).\"\n\n  The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a\nMacedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to\n1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely\nconcentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state\nif anyone declares themselves Macedonian.\n\n  In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned\nMacedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian\nvillages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in\n1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5\nmillion Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000\nin Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.\n\n  Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian\nhuman rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a\nfew years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in\nthe mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced\nthe Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of\nFlorina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the\nmajority of ethnic Macedonians live.\n\n  Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in\nwhich  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent,\nespecially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its\nnorthern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.\n\n  Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned\nGreece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who\nlargely live in Western Thrace).

If the person\nor company distributing PGP receives money for doing so, then it is\nclearly a sale (for example, if it were on Compuserve, they charge you\nfor access so they would be selling PGP).  When there is no charge for\nPGP things get less clear, but there would still be a reasonable view\nthat it is inducing an infringement.\n\n\nThis is a common misconception.  The patent laws do not mention any valid\npurpose for infringing a patent.  Although it is clear that in order to\ncreate a new invention either based on a prior patent or to avoid infringing\na prior patent, one must perform research on an existing patent.  To\njust say that you infringed a patent (assume we're not talking the RSA\npatent) only for research purposes (wink wink, nudge nudge) and then never\ndevelop any related invention (ie. only use it), would be a clear\ninfringement.\n", "label": 11}

{"text": "[reply to zazen@austin.ibm.com (E. H. Welbon)]\n \n \n \n \nFor many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an\nepistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of\nknowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence\nof gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most\nphilosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that\nmust be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical\nbasis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?\n \nThere is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence\nof any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses\nword \"on faith\", we just mean that having found this person to be\nreliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now.\nIf we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence\neverywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about\ngods?\n \nThe difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then\none of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing,\nrather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith\nis in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable\nbasis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at\nother times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist\nbelieves that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable\nknowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than\ntheism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other\nknowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than\nSanta Claus or the Easter Bunny?\n \nI would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn't\nrequire absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.

SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems.\n\nA SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data\nfrom the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data\nand moves it to memory.  A controller that allows reselection can operate\neven better with multiple devices.  This is espically true with SCSI tape\nunits.  For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is\nissued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other\ndevices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, do\nsomething else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to be\nwhat I am doing while reading this group.\n\nIts a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which,\nthanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.

What you described SOUNDS the same to me.  In fact, what little\n& i've studied on trannies, the instructor referred to the synchros as \"dogs\"\n& and said they were synonymous.  The gears are always meshed in a synchronized\n& gearbox, and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting. Or at least,\n& that is what i was taught.  Explain, por favour?\n\nMotorcycle transmissions don't have synchros.  The engagment dogs are very\ncorse and sloppy.  There are maybe 6-10 teeth (dogs) on the side of the\ngears that engage the next gear over as the forks slide the gears back\nand forth.  To shift:  start to apply pressure at the same time the\nclutch is pulled (the clutch is a hand lever) and shift quickly.  If \nyou try a slow lazy shift it will grind, you just have to pop it into\nthe next gear before it has a chance to grind.  There isn't a neutral\nbetween gears (obviously there is, but you can't select it with the\nshifter) so double clutching is not a possibility.  \"speed shifting\"\n(which is what I have always heard \"clutchless shifting\" called) works\npretty well for upshifts with some practice, but I usually use the\nclutch-especially for the lower gears.\n\nI think auto (as in automobile) trannys are similar, except that the\nengagment dogs are very fine, with no slop.  And the addition of\nsyncho rings.  The gear teeth are always engaged in auto transmissions\nthat are synchronized, but may not be in non-synchro gears (reverse\nand sometimes first).  \n", "label": 7}

{"text": "\n[...stuff deleted...]\n\nAndy-- I think we do agree, given your clarification of how we were \neach using the terms fact and theory.  I'll only add that I\nthink perhaps I feel more strongly about separating them,\nthough your usage is quite valid.\n\n\nI'll add here that any falsification or rejection does not in any way\nreduce its current usefulness.  So long as it accurately predicts or \ndescribes things we can observe.\n\nNot to be a pain in the ass, but is there any reason you don't\njust say _the theory of evolution_ rather than the _fact of evolution\nis still a theory_.  I'm asking because this whole thread got started\nbecause I was bothered by a post that referred to _the fact of evolution_,\nbasically leaving off the phrase _is still a theory_.  Without a \nclarification, like the one you just gave, just saying _the fact of\nevolution_ has a very different meaning to me.\n\nI'm not sure I agree here.  Again, it may be because I feel stronger\nabout separating terms.  I was trying to say that the _theories_\nproposed to explain the _mechanisms_ and the _mechanisms_ themselves\nare the only realities here.  It is the existence of mechanisms, not \nthe things themselves, that are so predictive as to be considered \nfact (as you would say).  There aren't really little planetary particle \nsystems called atoms out there.  Or I should say, and more to my original \npoint, it would be a leap of faith to say there are, because we observe only \nthe mechanisms.  There is no need to _believe_ there are _actually_\natoms out there as we have decided to think about them.  It's enough\nto discuss the mechanisms.  At any rate, I'm not sure I am being \nany clearer than before, but I thought it was worth a shot.\n\nThe bottom line, though, is I think we agree on two fundamental ideas:\n\n   1. --evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence (my way)\n      --the fact of evolution is a theory supported by observational\n        evidence (your way)\n\n   2. --creation is just an opinion.  If a theist wants to call it\n        a theory then he can.  I won't:  it has no supporting evidence \n\tand it neither predicts nor supports any observations that can\n        be made.

Perhaps you heard about\nanti-trust in the business world.\n\nSince we are debating the legality of a commercial\ntransaction, we must use the laws governing the guidelines\nand ethics of such transactions. Basic ANTI-TRUST law says\nthat, while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of\ninvesting, you can not acquire a large number of those\nshares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do so\nonly if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly,\nthe Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some\ndesigns, they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate.\nThey were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.\n\nThe palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the\nold tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi-ethnic /\nmulti-religious society, accepting the jews as neighbours\nwas no different, just another religion. Plus they paid fair\nmarket value, etc... They did not know they were victims of\nan international conspiracy. (I'm not a conspiracy theorist\nmyself, but this one is hard to dismiss).\n\n\n\n\nAgain Adam, the devil is in the details. I don't want to get\non a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its\nOK to return 100 deportes and leave the rest. Because 100 is\na nice number that you can devide by 10, 100 and besides, it\nhas an integer square root.\n\n\n\nDo you actually believe this? My experience tells me that\nevery palestinian I knew still keeps the key to his home, in\nPalestine. Besides they often refer to their exodus as an\nescape from hell (so to speak). I know none that agrees with\nyou. Did you sample their opinions? I know you don't care,\njust being rethorical.\n\n\n\n\nDon't get me wrong. I beleive that Israel is democratic\nwithin the constraints of one dominant ethnic group (Jews).\nIsrael probably had a few options after 1948: ethnic\ncleansing Serbian style, and deserve the wrath of the\ninternational community, or make the best out of a no win\ncondition: show the world how good Israel is towards the\n'bad' arabs. Personaly, I've never heard anything about the\narab community in Isreal. Except that they're there.  So\nyes, they're there. But as a community with history and\nroots, its dead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI stand corrected. I meant that the jewish culture was not\npredominant in Palestine in recent history. I have no\nproblem with Jerusalem having a jewish character if it were\npredominantly Jewish.

If you do get one, stay away from the 5 speed\nmanual with the deep low first gear.  They have put three of them in my\ntruck so far.  After about 1,500 miles, overdrive either starts\nrattling or hissing loudly.  There is no way to fix them.  Chevrolet \nsays that the noise is \"a characteristic of the transmission.\"\n\nAlso, if you are planning to use your truck to tow, the\ngear ratios in that tranny suck.  On a steep hill, you get up to about\n55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM (yellow line).  If you shift to third,\nthe RPM drop to only 2,500, and you begin to loose speed.  I should\npoint out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD (8600 GVW) trucks is a\ndetuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones.  They\ndropped the compression ratio, supposedly for \"engine longevity\"\nreasons.  So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does.\nOther things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan (3 times \nso far), paint (had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being\nshipped by rail with no covering), and suspension parts (link between\nstabilizer and control arm fell off).\n\nAny company can make a bad individual car, Chevrolet included.

{"text": "\nWow! You got me thinking now!\n\nThis is an interesting question in that recently there has been a \nmove in society to classify previously \"socially unacceptable\" yet legal \nactivities as OK.  In the past it seems to me there were always two \ncoexisting methods of social control.\n\nFirst (and most explicit) is legal control.  That is the set of \nactions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set \nof punishments.\n\nSecondly (and somewhat more hidden) is social control.  These are \nthe actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered \nby legal control, are scrictly controled by social censure. Ideally (if \nsocialization is working as it should) legal control is hardly ever needed \nsince most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of \nsocial censure.\n\nThe control manifests itself in day-to-day life as \"guilt\" and \n\"morality\".  I've heard it said (and fully believe) that if it weren't for \nthe VAST majority of people policing themselves, legal control would be \nabsolutely impossible.\n\nLately (last 50, 100 years?) however there has been a move to \nattempt to dissengage the individual from societal control (ie. if it ain't \nillegal, then don't pick on me).  I'm not saying this is wrong, merely \nthat it is a byproduct of a society which has:\n\n\t1) A high education level,\n\t2) A high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media,\n\t3) A high level of institutionalized individual rights, and\n\t4) A \"me\" oriented culture.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition, \nhere in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can\\\ncan't allow people to do based entirely on personal squeamishness, yet we \nare fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as \nthose freedoms don't impinge on another's.\n\nIMHO society is trying to persue two mutually exclusive ends here.  While we \nappreciate and persue individual rights (these satisfy the old \nterritoriality and dominance instincts), the removal of socialized, \ninherent fears based on ignorance will result in the \ncontinued destabilization of society.  \n\nI got no quick fix.  I have no idea how we can get ourselves out of this \nmess.  I know I would never consent to the roll-back of personal freedoms \nin order to \"stabilize\" society.  Yet I believe development of societies \nfollow a Darwinian process which selects for stability.  Can we find a \nsocial model which maximizes indiv. freed.'s yet is stable?  Perhaps it is \npossible to live with a \"non-stable\" society?\n\nAnybody see a way out?  Comments?\n\nPS.  Therefore answer to question #3:  We don't.  Do we want to?\n\n\n\nPhil Trodwell ", "label": 0}

Self sealing and such??\n\n\nJust thinking (okay rambling)..\n\nAlso why must the now inflated billboard, not be covered in the inside by a\nharder substance (such as a polymer or other agent) and then the now \"hard\"\nbillboard would be a now giant docking structure/space dock/station??", "label": 14}

{"text": "This is being posted as a general outline for your personal study of this \ndoctrine:\n\n\n                        THE DOCTRINE OF GOD\n\n\nI.   THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD\n     Of all of the doctrines of Scripture, this is the most\n     important.  The Bible is pre-eminently a revelation of God. \n     Therefore, our first objective in studying the Bible should\n     be to know God.\n     I believe that the Bible teaches that there are Three\n     Persons in the Godhead (Trinity):  God, the Father; God the\n     Son--the Lord Jesus Christ; and God, the Holy Spirit.  I\n     believe that they are individual Persons who are one in\n     nature, meaning that They are identical in nature, each\n     possessing the same divine attributes.  They are also\n     equally worthy of our worship, our trust, and our obedience.\n     Cf. Matt.28:19, 2 Cor.13:14; John 14:8,9,16,17.\n\nII.  THE ATTRIBUTES, or CHARACTERISTICS, OF THE GODHEAD.\n     A.  God's nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for\n         Himself: Jehovah.  He is the living God, eternal, and\n         unchanging.  He is without beginning, and without\n         ending.  Cf. Isa.42:8.\n     B.  God is a spirit.  Cf. John 4:24.\n     C.  God is love.  Cf. 1 John 4:8,16.\n         As such, He is gracious, merciful, good, faithful,\n         patient, and full of lovingkindness.  Cf. Psa 89:1,2;\n         Psa 103:8; Nahum 1:7.\n     D.  But God is also holy and righteous.  He is absolutely\n         without sin in His nature, and so is incapable of\n         sinning in though, word, or action.  Cf. Ex. 15:11; Isa.\n         6:3.\n     E.  God is omnipresent (everywhere present at the same time\n         in the completeness of His Person), omniscient (all\n         knowing, knowing all things--the end from the beginning,\n         infinitely wise), omnipotent (almighty, sovereign, with\n         unlimited power over all creation).\n         God is infinite in His presence, wisdom, and power.  It\n         is my conviction that the work of the Lord in our day\n         has become very man-centered, and that the people in our\n         churches know very little about God.  I believe that the\n         Lord's work needs to be God-centered, and that the\n         people of God need to understand that God is sovereign\n         in all things:  in the affairs of nations, in the lives\n         of all people, and in the carrying out of His purposes\n         regarding salvation.\n\nIII.     THE WORKS OF THE GODHEAD.\n     A.  In creation\n          All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in\n          creating, and all Three are active in sustaining\n          creation, and in ordering the course of human affairs\n          (for nations as well as individual people) to the end\n          of time.  Cf. Gen. 1:1,2; John 1:1-3; Col. 1:16-17;\n          Heb. 1:3.\n     B.  In salvation\n         In order to understand salvation I believe that it is\n         absolutely necessary to begin with God, not with man. \n         All three Persons of the Godhead have been, and are,\n         active in salvation.\n         1.  God, the Father\n             Salvation originated with God.  The Members of the\n             Godhead determined in eternity past that there would\n             be salvation, the conditions under which people\n             could and would be saved, and even who would be\n             saved.  Election to salvation is recognized in\n             Scripture as the work of  God, the Father.  Cf. Eph\n             1:3-4; 2 Thess 2:13-14.\n         2.  Christ, the Son of God\n             The Lord Jesus Christ, through His birth by the\n             virgin Mary, came to the earth to accomplish two\n             important works:\n             a.   He came as the final and complete revelation of\n                  God, the Father.  Cf. Col 1:15; heb 1:1-3.\n             b.   He came to provide salvation for all whom the\n                  Father had chosen.  He did this by His death on\n                  the Cross, by His bodily resurrection, and by\n                  His present intercessory work in heaven.  The\n                  work of salvation will be completed for us when\n                  the Lord returns.  Cf. Rom 5:8-10; 1 Cor 15:3-\n                  4; Heb 7:25, 1 John 3:2.\n         3.  The Holy Spirit\n             As the Author of Scripture, the theme of which is\n             Christ and His redemptive work, the Holy Spirit is\n             carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the\n             following ways:\n             a.   He convicts of sin. Cf. John 16:7-11\n             b.   He regenerates (known in the Bible as the new\n                  birth).  Cf. John 3:5-8.\n             c.   He indwells each believer to fulfill the work\n                  of sanctification.  Cf. John 14-16-17.\n             d.   He seals every believer in Christ, thus making \n                  salvation secure.  Cf. Eph 1:13-14.\n             e.   He baptizes every believer into the body of\n                  Christ.  Cf. Cor. 12:13\n             f.   He teaches every believer the truth of\n                  Scripture. Cf. John 14:26.\n             g.   He bestows spiritual gifts on the people of \n                  God for ministry.  (Cf. 1 Cor 12\n             h.   He restrains sin.  Cf Gal 5:16-26.\n             i.   He empowers for living and for service.  \n                  Cf. Acts 1:8\n\n", "label": 15}

{"text": "\tThe Jets gave the Canucks another run for their money in an almost\nidentical game to the first of the series but once again came up short as\nVancouver outscored Winnipeg 3-2.\n\tThe pattern of the first game was repeated tonight, with the Canucks\nscoring quickly and then going to sleep in the second period, only to stave\noff a Jet comeback with opportune goals from their greater talent. The Jets\nlooked more dangerous in this one but it didn't make a difference in the \nnumbers that counted: goals.\n\tVancouver's big line produced again, with centre Cliff Ronning and\nleft winger Geoff Courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to \nboost the Canucks to a 2-0 lead on giveaways by the suspect Jet defence of\nBautin and Ulanov. Mental lapses by the defence and goal-scoring talent\nin opportune areas made the difference in all three Canuck goals.\n\tHowever, as in the first game, the Jets worked hard to take the\ngame to the Canucks in the second period. The Jets dominated the second,\nchecking hard and penetrating the Vancouver zone without being challenged\nby a Canuck team that wanted to pack it in early. \n\tThe hard work paid off late in the second, when Tie Domi caught\nVancouver goalie Kirk McLean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make\nthe score 2-1. \n\tDomi's goal gave the Jets new life as they began to take the rush\nto the Canuck's collapsing defence. The Canucks were unwilling to do \nanything but let McLean take shots and clear the rebounds. The Jets were\nallowed to set up and make plays.\n\tBoth goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably.\nMcLean made three great saves in the second off a dancing Teammu Selanne\nwhile Essensa was rocked by a Pavel Bure drive. Selanne looked dangerous\non the rush as the Jets pressed a series of attacks into the Canuck\nzone. The Canucks, on the other hand, looked like they were offering four\nchecking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead.\n\tA series of minor penalties at the end of the second period\nresulted in a one man advantage for the Jets in the early third. The\nJet's Tempo Numminen drove a puck from the point through McLean's\nlegs and into the net to tie the game at 2-2.\n\tThe Canuck's discordant play picked up where it left off.\nThis was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected\nor were picked off by the Jets and individual rushes into a tight\nWinnipeg defence that were never supported.\n\tHowever, as in the first and second Canuck goals, a Jet defensive\nlapse (re: bonehead play) stalled the Winnipeg comeback. With the faceoff\nin the Winnipeg zone, Pavel Bure was left to stand in the crease with\nno Jet defender anywhere near him. Bure, who had been invisible in the\ngame up to that point, took a rebound and managed to roof it with a \nbackhand even though he was off balance. \n\tBy then it was too late for the Jets to come back. Essensa made it\nto the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing\nfor their attack. Canucks 3, Winnipeg 2.\n\tNext game is Friday at Winnipeg with the Jets in the hole by two games.\n- 30 -\n\n\n", "label": 10}

Crohn's has no dietary restriction in general.\n\n\nThe feeling obout this has changed in the GI community.  The current\nfeeling\nis that inflammation is not induced by food.  There is even evidence that\npatients deprived of food have mucosal atrophy due to lack of stimulation\nof\nintestinal growth factors.  There is now interest in providing small\namounts\nof nasogastric feeding to patients on IV nutrition.  But I digress.  \nSymptoms can be drastically enhanced by food, but not inflammation.\n\n\nThe low residue diet is appropriate for you if you still have obstructions.\nAgain, it is not felt that food causes inflammation.  These foods are\navoided because they may get stuck.  I'd go ahead and have the\nfudge, though ;-)  .\n\nSpencer makes an especially good point in having an observant and\ninformed patient.  Would that many patients be able to tell what\ncauses them problems.  The digestive processing idea is changing, but\nif a food causes problems, avoid them.  Be sure that the foods are \ntested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause.  Crohn's\ncommonly causes intermittent symptoms and some patients end up with\nseverly restricted diets that take months to renormalize.\n\nThere was a good article in the CCFA newsletter recently that discussed\nthe issue of dietary restriction of fiber.  It would be worth reading\nto anyone with an interest in Crohn's.\n\nAnd, as I always say when dealing with Crohn's, as does Spencer, Good Luck!", "label": 13}

The organization of larger committees to be in constant contact with\n         each other and subject to a central body.\n      5. Organization of units of guerilla fighters.\"\n\nNow, on page 105, Atamian's book quotes of Armenian constitution:\n\n \"...

All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled, everything\n that the people had has been taken away from them, and we found them\n in a destitute situation.

He left his third-floor bedroom and began\nlooking around the house, making sure women and children were secure and \nchecking that everyone had their gas masks on properly. Within hours, the    \ncompound became an inferno. Nine Branch Davidians excaped.\n   This is their story, gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them\nwho are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder. That day the \nsix said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world    \nsince Koresh's right-hand man, Steve Schneider, ripped out the compounds's \nphone line after FBI agents called before dawn Monday saying this was the\ncults last chance: Come out or prepare to get forced out.\n    They kept their word. By dawn, tanks were battering the Mount Carmel\ncompound, punching for hours to creat holes for tear gas to enter. The BD\nmeanwhile proceeded with their daily routines. Strapped into gas masks, the\nwomen did laundry. Others read Bibles in their rooms. The 17 children, all\nunder 10, remained by their mothers' sides. Still, it was hard to ignore what    \nwas happening around them. Each time a tank rammed the poorly-constructed building\nit shook violently. Cult members dodges falling gypsum wallboard and doors.\nHundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling\nthe air with noxious fumes. The flying canisters were more frightening than\nthe tanks. At least one man was hit in the face. The gas began filling the air,\ndriven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks\nmade. Scattered throughout the house, the cult members made no efforts to\ngather. Then the FBI sent in its biggest weapon -- a massive armored vehicle\nheaded for a chamber, lined with cinder blocks, where authorities hoped to \nfind Koresh and Schneider and fire tear gas directly at them.\n  Here the cult members' story diverges from the government's version. The\nFBI says cult members set fires in three places. But each of the six cult\nmembers, in separate discussions with lawyers, consistently gave versions\nat odds with the FBI's account. They say the tank flattened a barrel of \npropane, spilling its contents. And as the tank thundered through the house,\nit tipped over lit lanterns, spitting flames that ignited the propane and\nother flammables. The home of used lumber, plywood, and wallboard tacked \ntogether with tar paper was vulnerable. The building erupted. Nine BD's\nescaped jumping through windows and dashing through other openings.

Neto):\n\nThis all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to\ndo with this.\n\nBackground first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as\nX accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS\nand Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.\n\nThat said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display\non a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port\nwhich can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say\nyou hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could\nput in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system.\nYou could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to\nmix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could\nhave 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays,\nor 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any\ncombination.\n\nBecause of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use\nof the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different\nin meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.\n\nThe reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12\nscreens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server\nthat determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h,\nMAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek,\nthis is 12.\n\nAs such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e.\nX server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X\nI'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is\nnot the case.\n\nWe just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of\ncourse, I could say \"Buy all you want, we'll support more.\"\n-- ", "label": 5}

O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free\nfrom all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be\nestablished in the self.\n  \n                                PURPORT\n\n All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three\nmodes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which\ncause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive\nactivities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of\nsense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna,\nas a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to\nthe transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the\nbeginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme\ntranscendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are\nstruggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of\nthe material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get\nrid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense\ngratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the\nchance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the\nUpanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a\npart of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the\nbeginning of transcendental life.\n\n As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in\nthe material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities\nsuch as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating\nsuch dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This\ntranscendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one\nis fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.\n\nBhagavad-Gita As It is\nBooks of A.C.

He is not in fact making\nthe logical error of which you accuse him.  He stated the fact that the\nBible does not say that babies cannot be baptized.  Also, we know that\nthe Bible says that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven.\n_Everyone_ includes infants, unless there is other Scripture to the\ncontrary, i.e. an exception.

The conditions were\nwonderful, thanks to our Armenians, who received us. But it's not relaxing all\nthe same. I don't know how everyone else feels about it, but for me it's \ntorture. We don't have a place to call our own. I had a two bedroom apartment \nin Sumgait, my children went to school and we lived well, in friendship. It's \npainful that in our times, in 1988, in the Soviet period, people can break \ninto our apartment and try to kill me and my children, in whom I've put all my\nefforts and my whole youth. Everything was going well for us: my older \ndaughter was studying at the Institute, the middle one was preparing to enter \nmedical school and was interning as an orderly, and my youngest had been sick \nfor a long time, but had returned to health. I have been though a lot in my \nlife: it's been seven years since I lost my husband, I raised my children by \nmyself. Lots of women have similar fates, but there's nothing to be done about\nit. But I can't control myself when I remember what happened in Sumgait on \nFebruary 27, 28, and 29, it was just a horror, it's indescribable.\n\nOn February 27 our relative, Ira, came to visit us. She's better friends with\nmy oldest daughter, and so right away she asked, \"Where's Vika?\" I say,\n\"Vika's off in Pirkuli on a trip for three days, she's supposed to come back\ntomorrow.\" My middle daughter, Gaya, had baked a cake and we sat there talking\nand laughing, drinking tea. Then Gaya and Diana went to walk Ira home.\n\nThey left and a few minutes went by; suddenly I hear noise. I raced out to\nthe balcony--our balcony is right across from the bus station, we live at the\ncorner of Mir and Druzhba Streets--I look and see that there are hoards of\npeople near the bus station and they're all shouting something. What they're\nshouting I can't understand. Our neighbor is standing on his balcony, too. I\nask, \"Nufar, what's happened?\" He says, \"I don't know, I can't figure it out\neither.\" I got scared--the kids had gone outside, and I wanted to run after\nthem, but then there was a knock at the door. I open the door and it's the\nkids. \"Mamma,\" says Gayane, \"you'll never believe what's going on out there! \nIt's awful!\" Ira says, \"Aunt Zina, they're shouting, 'Karabagh! Karabagh! \nKarabagh is ours!' We didn't know what was going on. They're threatening to \ndrive out the Armenians and slaughter them.\"\n\nI called my brother, and his wife answered the phone. I said, \"Aunt Tamara, \ndon't worry, Ira is staying here with us, and we'll see her home later.\" I \ncouldn't shut my eyes all night long, even until morning. I was worried about\nVika. My God, what was going on, what had happened?!\n\n-Gayane: That day, on the 27th, we stood on the balcony and observed what was \nhappening, although Mamma wouldn't allow us to watch all of it. There weren't \n50 yards between our building and the bus station. We could see and hear \neverything perfectly. They were stopping buses, dragging people out, leading \nall the passengers out, looking for Armenians. If they found an Armenian on \nthe bus, then it started . . .I don't know what to call it . . .\n\n-Zinaida: It's called slaughter.\n\n-Gayane: The mob would descend on people and beat them. I don't know if they \nwere killing them or not, but when they left them, they lay still, not moving,\nas though nothing was left of them. One person was lying there and they \nstarted dragging him. The police were standing right there, to the side, not \ndoing anything, they didn't take any steps to calm that mob.\n\nIt was awful to stand there and watch it all from the balcony. And you \ncouldn't go anywhere, somehow . . . you wanted to be able to see everything\nso as to tell of it later. We wanted to leave Sumgait that day. What kept us\nwas the idea that we live in the Soviet Union, and that something would be\ndone about it. Where in the world was our government?!\n\n-Zinaida: We couldn't leave town, of course, because our older daughter wasn't\nhome. And at the same time I was terrified for Gaya and Diana. On Sunday \nmorning when I went to see Ira home, our neighbor said, \"Zin', you know they \nwent into Valodya's house and smashed everything he had. They murdered his \nfather and two sons.\" Valodya is our neighbor, he's an Armenian, he lives on \nthe first floor. I think, my God, what is happening?! And in broad daylight!\n\nI saw Ira home and when on the way back I came across a mob shouting \"Slay the\nArmenians! Karabagh is ours!\" This was at 12 o'clock in the afternoon. On the \nway I stopped into a bread store and the saleswoman says, \"They beat our store\nmanager, they thought he was an Armenian and they beat him, but he was an \nAzerbaijani.\" And I asked, \"Did they kill him?\" She says, \"No, he's in serious\ncondition.\" I left there and started to walk home on that same street, but the\nmob started moving in my direction. I turned off the street and went down the \nlittle way that goes toward the Sputnik store. There I met another crowd, but \nthese weren't bandits, these were our people from Sumgait. I was so frightened\nthat I walked without knowing where was going, I couldn't feel my legs or the \nground under my feet. I was walking and there was a boy standing before my \neyes. This was on the 27th, around evening time. He ran under our balcony, and\nthe mob surged toward him shouting, \"He's an Armenian, get him!\" He wore a \nblack coat. They grabbed him, that boy, near the bus stop, I saw it. They \ngrabbed him by the legs and struck his head on the asphalt.\n\nI made it home but I just couldn't calm down. My oldest daughter was in my \nthoughts. I was thinking, my daughter's coming home now, they'll stop her bus \nand she'll be gone. There's no police, no protection, nothing. It's like they \nhad all died, there's no one, nothing, no authorities whatsoever. I can't even\nfind the words for it! I look and see an Ikarus arriving. Before going to the \nbus station they stop near our place, across from the Kosmos movie theater. So\nthis Ikarus stops  there and the gang is yelling, the Azerbaijanis are running\ntoward it yelling, \"Armenians out!\" And I see them take the Armenians and beat\nthem, killing them. I can't watch it any more. It was a nightmare. I just \ncouldn't watch it. But Gaya was standing there watching it, and I scolded her.\nShe says, \"Mamma, I have to see it, I have to know what's happening, I have to\nsee it with my own eyes so I can tell our people of it later. So our children \nwill know.\"\n\nGayane: We saw a great deal on the 27th. They caught no less than 20 people\nbefore my eyes. I can't say for sure if they killed them or not . . .\n\n-Zinaida: There were too many people there, the mob was too big. You couldn't \nmake anything out. But I saw that boy in the black coat with my own eyes. He\nwas 18 or 19 years old.\n\n-Gayane: I think he was older, probably, about 22. A tall fellow, a big guy, \nin a coat. He was walking quickly, but when they shouted that he was an\nArmenian, he tore off running. And the mob went after him. They caught him \nright under our balcony. I don't know. I don't think there could have been \nmuch left of him after that. You can imagine what happens when a crowd attacks\none person. It was a mob, big, angry, and featureless. You know, there was a \nsimilarity in the way they were dressed, mostly they were wearing long black \ncoats. You couldn't even tell them apart, they were all wearing black and they\nall looked alike.\n\n-Zinaida: When they picked up that boy and struck him against the asphalt and \nhe cried \"Mamma!\" I ran into the room. I couldn't watch any longer. An awful \nlot was going on right then, in various places, it wasn't only that boy, \nseveral people were being beaten up. You couldn't see all of it at once, but \nwhen that boy cried \"Mamma!\" I immediately started watching only him.\n\n-Gayane: On that first day it went on from about six in the morning until\ntwelve at night. At midnight they dispersed and the police took their place.\nThey were scattered about in all districts. But how can you explain the fact\nthat by morning, when it had already started getting light, around seven\no'clock, our police were gone? The police disappeared and yielded their\npositions to the bandits. In the morning they started gathering at our inter-\nsection again, at the bus station and at the entrance to downtown. From\nmorning on all the roads and mass transit stops were covered, and by nine\no'clock you couldn't even see the ground. There were thousands of people in\nthe crowd. Again they began stopping vehicles and checking for Armenians.\n\n-Zinaida: They had signals. I realized that when I noticed that they made a \ncross with their arms, they crossed their arms over their heads. The cross,\nevidently, meant that the vehicle had Armenians in it. They let the\nAzerbaijani cars through, and they stopped the Armenian ones and started\ntheir pogrom.\n\n-Gayane: They stopped a white Zhiguli and asked the driver what his \nnationality was. He got out and said they were from Baku. \"But what is your\nnationality?\" He says Armenian. They immediately start shouting, \"Ermeni,\nErmeni!\" And he says, \"What's going on? I'm coming from Baku. I don't live\nin Sumgait.\" \"Doesn't matter, who cares if you're from Baku or Sumgait.\"\nAnyway the crowd pounced on him and started beating him, and they dragged a \nwoman--his wife, probably--out of the car. At this point the police came and \ntook the two and led them away. Then the mob started smashing the car, and \nthen burned it. The flames blazed . . . it was a horrible fire! Then everyone \nran away, they thought the car was going to explode. About 20 minutes later \nanother car comes along, a green Moskvich. They ran up shouting \"Ermeni! \nErmeni!\" But this time they didn't pull the people out of the car, they didn't\nbeat them. Maybe they burned them along with the car, because no one emerged \nfrom the flames. The neighbor boy Vakhit was standing on the balcony too, \nacquaintances of his walked by below, and he asked them and they said, \"Yes, \nthey burned them along with the car.\" About two hours later a whole wedding \nprocession came by, and there was a doll on the first car. We thought they \nwere Armenians, but the cars started to honk loudly. They were Azerbaijanis, \nand they were immediately allowed through.\n\n-Zinaida: The driver waved his hand as if to say 'get out of the way.' The\nwhole crowd parted and the procession passed through freely.\n\n-Gayane: By the way, at the marriage hall, which is right in the courtyard\nof our building, there was a wedding that day. The Azerbaijanis were cele-\nbrating and dancing. On the streets there was grief and death, people were\nbeing killed, and people were celebrating the whole time.\n\n-Zinaida: Before the apartment itself was attacked I asked Gaya to call and \nfind out when the tourist bus was supposed to arrive. She went to her \ngirlfriend's in the building, she lives in the first entryway, on the third \nfloor. Gaya came back and said, \"Mamma, the bus is supposed to come around\neight, after eight.\" You can imagine what I was feeling, how hard it was:\nVika knew nothing about what was happening and was coming to meet her death. \nThen I heard shouting. I raced to the window and see that the belongings of \nour neighbors from the second entryway are being thrown outdoors. They were \nthrashing about with the pillows and the feathers were lying like snow. I \nstarted to cry. I am walking around the room, crying, wailing: Vika's not \nhere, what will come of her . . . Gaya, of course, was consoling me: \"Mamma, \nnothing will happen to her, don't worry, calm down, she's in good company, \nthey'll look out for her.\"\n\nDiana: I saw the green car burn. The car was burning when we went out onto the\nbalcony. Gaya pushed me away, telling me to get off the balcony. I left. Then \nthey came up to the balcony and asked if there were any Armenians here.\n\n-Zinaida: You're right, I forgot about that, that was on the 27th.\n\nDiana: There's a small, grassy area in front of our balcony; there are trees\nplanted there. The mob asked if there were any Armenians in the building.\nAll the neighbors said, no, there are no Armenians here. There weren't a lot\nof Armenians in our building, but there weren't just a few Armenian families, \neither.\n\n-Gayane: They fell upon the apartments on the 28th. There were terribly many \nof them. Our courtyard is huge, and it was completely filled with them.\n\n-Zinaida: Katusev had made an appearance on television earlier. He said that \ntwo people, Azerbaijanis, had been killed in Karabagh. And when he said that \n. . . you know how bees sound, have you heard how they buzz? It was like the \nbuzzing of millions of bees . . . and with this buzzing they flew into our \ncourtyard, howling and shouting. I don't know how to describe it. By this \npoint we were afraid to watch from the balcony, but when I looked out of the \nbedroom window--the Znaniye Bookstore is down there, and Armenians live on the \nsecond and fourth floors--I saw their things being thrown out the windows. I \nrealized that they would be upon us any minute. I shouted to Gayane, \"Gaya, \nhide the gold.\" That's honestly what I told my child. I grabbed Diana. I \ndidn't know what to do! Vika still wasn't home, and it was already getting \ndark. I was afraid to look at the time because I was already horrified as it \nwas.\n\n-Gayane: Just in case, we changed the television channel from the Moscow \nstation to the Azerbaijani one.\n\n-Zinaida: And turned it up loud.\n\n-Gayane: We never listened to Azerbaijani music. It just didn't do much for \nus. In all those years we almost never listened to it. But sometimes we would\nwatch some entertainment show or film on Azerbaijani television. And that was \nit. And here we had it turned up full blast. So they would think we were \nAzerbaijanis.\n\n-Zinaida: Well you can imagine, they're slaughtering Armenians, robbing them, \nand we're listening to this concert music from Baku. Our Azerbaijani neighbors\nsuggested we do it, they knocked on the door and told Gaya to turn on \nAzerbaijani music. But we already had it on anyway. Turn on the lights, they \ntold us, so they will think you're not Armenians. They're saying the Armenians\nare afraid to turn on their lights, they're hiding.\n\n-Gayane: Apparently there was some kind of arrangement, because we noticed \nthat the lights were off only in Armenian apartments, that is, the \nAzerbaijanis were warned, and every last one of them had their lights on.\nWhen we turned the lights off two of our neighbors came immediately, and\nlater, another one. \"Turn on the lights,\" they told us, \"please. Nothing will\nhappen. Be calm. Nothing will happen.\"\n\n-Zinaida: \"We won't allow them to come into your apartment.\"\n\n-Gayane: We believed those people. We had never done anything bad to them.\n\n  -Zinaida: After the whole nightmare, about March 15, before we left for\nArmenia, when I was coming into the building they were all crying. The\nAzerbaijanis were crying, saying, \"Can it be there is no God? How could\nthey raise their hands against your family? You never did anyone any harm,\nyou never refused anyone anything, not in hard times, or in time of fortune,\nor in time of mourning. How could they give you away? How could they sell you \ndown the river?\" They really had given us away. Some of them protected us, but\nothers gave us away. They sold us down the river.\n\n-Gayane: I was wearing slacks that day, and when it all began I became \ncautious for some reason and I changed my clothes. Azerbaijani women don't \nwear pants. Young Armenian and Russian girls in Sumgait wore pants, but the \nAzerbaijanis found that very strange. And I thought I better put on a skirt, \notherwise they won't believe me if I told them we were Azerbaijanis. There was\nnothing else we could do. No other way out. I was forced to turn myself into \nGod knows who. I let my hair down, tousled it, and threw a scarf over my head.\n\n-Zinaida: And she told me, \"Mamma, you hide. Take Diana and go into the other \nroom. You two look more like Armenians. They'll figure out that we're \nArmenians right away.\" But how could I go away and leave her there?!\n\n-Gayane: I went out onto the balcony. It worked out better that way. We were \nthe only Armenian family in the fourth entryway. This gave us hope: we were \nthe only ones, the neighbors wouldn't let them in. They, the Azerbaijanis, \nwould fear for themselves and for their children. I looked and saw someone \ncrawling up on the balcony from below, it was easy to get up onto our balcony.\nWhen we would lose the keys the neighbors would let up into their places and \nwe would crawl across onto our balcony and get in that way. So I turned around\nand saw a guy with a knife on our balcony. He looks at me and shouts, \"What \nnationality are you here?\"\n\n-Zinaida: At the same time they were knocking on the door.\n\n-Gayane: \"What nationality are you?\" he's shouting. Well at first I was\nfrightened, but then I got control of myself and answered in perfect \nAzerbaijani, \"You should be ashamed of yourself, asking a question like that.\nCan't you see I'm an Azerbaijani? If I were an Armenian would I come out to \nmeet you face to face and look you in the eyes?\" He looks at me and tells the\npeople with him, \"Yes, Azerbaijanis live here.\" From below they tell him,\n\"Check it out, it can't be, they have to be Armenians.\" And he asks me again,\n\"What nationality are you?\" I say, \"Can't you see?\" I started fuming. I could\nnot say anything else. \"You're blind, that's for sure! You can yell all you\nwant, but that won't make us Armenians.\" I hear them breaking down our\ndoor, and Mamma went toward the door. I say, \"I don't have time to deal\nwith you, they're breaking down our door.\" 1 go to the door and ask, \"Who is\nit?\" They answer, \"Open up!\" I say, \"Wait, why are you breaking the door?\nWhat's going on? I'm opening up.\" We never locked the lower lock, it was\nbroken, but now they had locked it out of fear, and I couldn't get it open. I\nsay wait, I'm looking for the key. I opened the door--it was almost broken\ndown already. I opened the door and they burst in. I say, \"What's going on?\nWhy are you breaking down our door?\"\n\n-Zinaida: Then they started climbing in from the balcony. They're shouting, \n\"Why don't you open the door?\" And I say, \"Well you've already come in the \nbalcony.\" Then Diana sees their knives, runs into the bathroom, and closes the\ndoor. Gaya cries out, \"Mamma, Diana ran into the bathroom!\" I ran to the door \nand forgot that we were pretending to be Azerbaijanis, and said in Armenian: \n\"Diana, open the door!\" Gaya tried to calm them down, and I'm shouting with\ntears in my eyes for Diana to open the door.\n\n-Diana I was sitting on the couch with my doll, Little Red Riding Hood. That \nguy climbed in from the balcony with a big knife with a yellow handle. They \nput it up to Mamma's stomach. I ran to the bathroom, opened the door, and \nslammed it behind me. I was frightened, and started to cry. I shouted, \"Mamma,\nthey want to kill you!\" And then . . . then they started shouting, \"Give us \nyour passports.\" And Gaya says, \"What do you need passports for, we're \nAzerbaijanis.\"\n\n-Gayane: I tried to convince them that we were Azerbaijanis, I was trying\neverything I could, I could get on my knees and plead. I could humble myself, \nbecause at that moment I was worried about other lives than just my own. To be\nhonest I didn't care about anything else, as long as my little sister would \nsurvive, her life and health had cost us so dearly! I tell them, \"What, don't \nyou understand anything?\" They started shouting, they were tremendously \nexcited, shouting with terribly loud voices, saying that in Stepanakert their \ngirls were being killed, raped, and tossed around with pitchforks. Why \nshouldn't they do the same to us? I said, \"Who's doing all that? Who is doing \nit? Some Armenians! What does that have to do with us? Give me the knife, I'll\ncut my own face.\" \"Now you calm down,\" they tell me.\n\nZinaida: I told them, \"Why didn't you deal with them there! There, in \nKarabakh? Nothing has happened here, no one has been fighting here, not we \nwith the Armenians, nor they with us. Why didn't you give it right back to\nthem there? What've we got to do with this?\" I got confused. I had been\nsaying that we were Azerbaijanis, but suddenly I started speaking as though\nI were an Armenian, but they didn't notice. One of them was next to me,\nwith a knife at my breast. And he says to the others, \"What pretty girls.\" He\nmeant Gaya and my 10-year-old Diana. I was terrified. Gaya started assuring \nthem that we were Azerbaijanis. One guy stood in the doorway and gave us bad \nlooks.\n\n-Gayane: He demanded the passports. I said, \"Young man, I don't have my \npassport here.\" He says, \"Let's have the passport, we won't believe you\nwithout your passport.\" And one of them started hurriedly searching for\ndocuments. They turned the wardrobe in the other room upside down, took the \npicture off the wall, and started pulling the clothes off their hooks, yelling\nand shouting, \"Passport! Passport!\" They all started yelling, there was so \nmuch noise in the apartment. They were all shouting. My hair stood on end. \nSuddenly I said, \"Listen, my Papa died, 40 days haven't passed yet, we have a \nMuslim household, we're in mourning, you should be ashamed of yourselves, \nyou've disgraced your honor.\" And then Mamma started to cry.\n\n-Zinaida: I started crying: \"My husband died, 40 days haven't yet passed,\naren't you ashamed of yourselves!\" In fact my husband had died seven years\nearlier, in 1981. \"We're in mourning, and you burst in here demanding docu-\nments. The documents are at the housing office, I'm filing for my pension.\"\nWell it seemed like they believed us. Then one guy said, \"They're Lezgins.\nCan't you see, there are no men here, only women. Leave.\" Another fellow in\nthe group agreed with him, he also said that we were Lezgins. But a third\nsaid, \"No, they're Armenians.\" Well the other two convinced him, I don t know \nhow, and all the rest of them listened to them too. There were about 50 of \nthem, if not more, all in our three-room apartment, even the entryway was \nfilled. They started leaving. Yes, we're Lezgins, we're Lezgins.\" They started\nleaving, and one of them took our tape recorder with him. And the one who had \nfirst called us Lezgins says, \"Leave that, what are you doing?\" They seemed to\nobey that guy.\n\n-Gayane: He was tall, wearing baggy jeans and a coat.\n\n-Zinaida: With a little moustache, I think.\n\n-Gayane: No, he didn't have a moustache, he was tall with brown hair, he \nwasn't a bad-looking sort. He didn't have anything in his hands.\n\n-Zinaida: He stood at the threshold.\n\n-Gayane: Yes, he didn't look like a bad guy, and you know, his face seemed \nfamiliar to me. I had seen him somewhere. And more than once. But I can't \nremember where. When he came in I was stupefied, I had a premonition that he \nwouldn't be able to remain indifferent. When he said that we were Lezgins and \nthat they should leave, such gladness started to glow inside of me. Hope. They\ncontinued to argue on their way out. Some said, \"They're Armenians all the \nsame.\" And that fellow answered, \"even if they are Armenians, it's shameful,\nthe father died, they're mourning, there's nothing but women in the house, \nthere's no men. We should stay out of the apartment.\" \"What do you mean, stay \nout? We can go in there!\" And he said, \"No, we should stay out, they're \nLezgins, we're leaving here.\" The three of them protected us.\n\n   -Zinaida: No, the two of them. The one in the short coat and the one in the\ngrey suit, who stood at the threshold, about 19 or 20 years old. Well they\nwere all young really. The two of them defended us.\n\n-Diana: Three, three!\n\n-Zinaida: Do you remember the third one, Diana?\n\n-Diana: Yes, he was wearing dark clothes.\n\n-Gayane: The third one was the one who came back. He wore a long brown coat.\n\n-Diana: He wore a long, darkish brown coat, and his hair was dark too. When \nthey left, they told him downstairs that those women were Armenians, and ran \nback and said that they were going to kill us.\n\n-Zinaida: They had all left, and we had started to calm down a little, and I\nclosed the door. And then there is a knock. I told Gaya, \"Take Diana and go\ninto the other room.\" My daughters went into the dining room, and I opened the\ndoor. There was a guy there who said, \"Run, hide! They're coming to kill you \nnow!\" We ran up to the third floor. We had some good neighbors up there,\nAzerbaijanis. I sent the kids and stood there alone, not knowing what to do. \nI was so far gone . . . Out of a whole room I couldn't even think of anything \nto take. I even forgot to take my work documents; at the time I had been \npreparing a report to send to Baku, and the documents were at home. I couldn't\nsee anything . . . I could only see Vika, my older daughter. I sent Gaya and \nDiana upstairs, and stood there asking that fellow, \"Should I close the door \nand leave everything like this?\" He says, \"What do you mean, door? Get out of \nhere, they're coming to kill you! What are you standing there for?\" And I ran \nafter the children.\n\n-Gayane: We barely had time to get up to the third floor when they burst into \nour apartment and started shouting, \"Where are the Armenians?\" We were already\nat the neighbors'. They had an infant at the time, and the neighbor said, \n\"Don't you worry, I'm not letting anyone in this apartment no matter what.\"\n\n-Zinaida: On the third floor there I started asking the folks, our neighbors,\nto go meet Vika. The bus was due to arrive at eight o'clock. I dissolved in\ntears, Gaya was soothing me, Diana was next to us, she was crying too, and I'm\nalready thinking that I've lost my older daughter, but deep in my heart I \nstill believe she's alive . . . And my tears choked me. I was going out of my\nmind. But no one could leave the building, the courtyard was packed with\npeople, swarming with them. From the balcony the neighbor in whose apartment \nwe were hiding asked the bandits, \"Where are those Armenians, the ones who \nwere at home? Where did they make off to?\" They told him they didn't know. \nThey asked him where he lived. He answered, \"Can't you see, on the third \nfloor.\" He asked them specially to divert attention from his own apartment. We\nheard them taking free reign of our apartment, and they threw our color \ntelevision off the balcony and it exploded.\n\n-Gayane: Mamma was crying the whole time. She fell into a faint and we brought\nher around and held her back, because the whole time she kept making for the \ndoor to go outside, alternately raving and sobbing, shouting, and calling \nVika. She didn't notice us, probably because we were next to her. Her thoughts\nwere only on Vika. The neighbors who were hiding us were calming her too, \noffering tea.\n\n-Zinaida: We are very grateful to them. Thanks to them my children and I are\nalive, well, and unharmed. When they were throwing our belongings out and \nburning them--the beds, the pillows, and the chairs--our neighbor came to us \nand said, \"How lucky you are that it's not you standing there naked, but some \nother woman instead. You're from our part of the building you lost your \nhusband, you have children, thank God you're not in her position, we wouldn't \nhave been able to take it. I don't know what I would do.\" He of course \nwouldn't have done anything, he was just trying to calm us down. In the yard \nthey were torturing our neighbors, fellow Armenians They lived on the fifth \nfloor, in the third entryway. A married couple, Vanya and Nina, and their \nthree children. Their last name is V. They hid their two daughters, and stayed\nwith their son to defend themselves, they even got boiling water ready, and an\naxe, and held them off for a long time, but the . . . They beat up the \nhusband, dragged the wife outside, and stood her naked next to our burning \nthings; her husband was lying at her feet on the ground. The crowd shouted, \n\"Look at the naked Armenian!\" They were going to throw the poor woman into the\nfire. The neighbors came out, an Azerbaijani woman threw her a scarf, and she \ncovered herself with it, and the neighbors led her off to their apartment. \nAll the neighbors saw and heard it . . .\n\n-Gayane: Mamma wouldn't allow it but I went to the window and saw her standing\nthere, and they took skewers that had been heated in the fire and stuck them \ninto her body. Our neighbor, who lived in the same entryway as Nina--she \nlives with us in the same boarding house now--saw what they had done, Nina \nshowed her, from her knees up, almost up to her neck, her whole body was \ncovered, riddled, with wounds.\n\n-Zinaida: In the morning, during the night of the 29th, rather, after one\no'clock, two buses approached the station. I wanted to run out. By then I\ndidn't care any more if I lived or died, but Gayane wouldn't let me go, and\nthe neighbors said that I would bring disaster to them and they would be\nslain along with their children. Gaya was crying and said that I forgot about\nthem, my other children, but I could only think of Vika. I imagined her torn\nto pieces, I'm a mother, and they're just children, they don't understand I\nwould have jumped off the balcony and run to the soldiers for help. I was\ngoing to do it but Gayane wouldn't let me: \"Mamma, please! Mamma, I beg of \nyou!\" The neighbors were sleeping and Gayane woke them with her cries. So we \nheld on that way till morning.\n\nOn the morning of the 29th I told our neighbor I was going to go downstairs to\nour apartment, maybe Vika was lying there, murdered. He told me he would go \nhimself. He was gone for about five minutes, but it seemed like an eternity to\nme. He returned and said there was no one there, nothing. I went down too, \nstole down like a mouse, and slipped in everything was thrown all about. I \ndidn't go to the soldiers because the armored personnel carriers were far \naway, farther than the bus station. I began looking for the briefcase with my \nwork in it. I was miserable because of my daughter, and at the same time \nbecause of my work. My documents were there, my travel papers--I worked in the\ntransport division -- and my trip sheets.\n\n-Gayane: Mamma is a very responsible person, she was always ready to work \naround the clock to do her job.\n\n-Zinaida: I look around and I can't find the briefcase. I didn't care about \nthe fact that everything had been stolen out of all three of my rooms, that\neverything was smashed, and the furniture was broken, I worried about that\nlater, but at first I was concerned about the lost documents. I went into the\nkitchen. My daughter had hidden some valuables in the gas stove: my ring and \nmy earrings. It was all there. Five minutes passed and Gayane ran in and said,\n\"Mamma, hurry.\" And Diana came downstairs too. Gayane found  her coat among \nthe debris, and Diana found her track shoes, her coat, and some of her \ndresses.\n\n-Diana: Immediately after we got back up to the neighbors they started \nthrowing things around in the apartment under us. They threw a television onto\nthe asphalt, it exploded so violently it sounded like a thunderclap. Then, \nwhen Vika wasn't there, I wouldn't eat, and they forced me, but I couldn't \neat. Because I loved Vika terribly and she and I had always gone to the movies\nand gone for walks in the park. When we went into our apartment the next day \nand everything was broken, right away I started looking for my dolls and my \nbooks, but I didn't see anything. When we went back upstairs I managed to take\ntwo cups from my tea service, and Gaya took Vika's suit and one of her own \ndresses. My Italian boots were gone, my brown coat, it was beautiful, there \nwasn't a one of my beautiful dolls, and my giant lion was gone too, the one \nthat had been on top of the television. He was very large and very handsome. \nI had two satchels, one for first grade and the other for second grade, one \nwas yellow-green with a boy and a girl on it, they're playing a drum and a \nviolin, and there is a dog sitting there closing its ears, and on the other \none were the letters A, B, C, D, E and the numbers 4+5, two girls and a boy \nwith their mouths open like they are singing. They were beautiful satchels. \nThey were gone too. I had many books, I collected them, they were in the \nbedside tables. And a boy had given me a little apron and a headband for my \nbirthday, they weren't around either. And I had some big books, fat ones, and \nthey disappeared, only one was left, The Malachite Box. The Adventures of \nKarlson, Pippi Longstockings, and Fairy Tales of the World were left. All the \nother books were gone.\n\n-Zinaida: I continued searching for my briefcase, and then my supervisor\narrived. He had waited for me until nine o'clock, but I didn't appear, and he\nthought something must have happened, so he came. He's a Russian, Aleksei \nSemyonovich Lomakin. Alik Aliyev, the mechanic, came with him. When they saw \nmy wrecked apartment they were just petrified, they could not say a thing. \nWhen I saw them I started crying. My Azerbaijani neighbors came in. Some of \nthem were crying, others were helping me pick up. I go on looking for my \ndocuments and at the same time put things into the wardrobe. Now that I \nremember it it's both funny and painful: How could I have thought that I had \nreturned to my apartment and that everything had gone back to normal? \nIncidentally, later, when I went back to the apartment again those things were\ngone too. And the door was gone. After my supervisor left, in the afternoon, \nthe neighbor said that we should leave, find another refuge. \"I'm afraid,\" he \nsaid, \"that someone saw you come to my apartment, and that they could kill you\nand us too. My God, where could I go it was daytime and those . . . I don't \neven know what to call them, the bandits, those marauders, those jackals, I \ndon't know what to call them, I can't find the words, they were everywhere. \nWhere should I go with two girls? When I opened the door I had tears in my \neyes, and I was terrified . . . And he said, \"Go to Alik's, he's an\nAzerbaijani, too.\" and I say, \"You should have said that earlier, when my \nsupervisor was here with the car, he could have taken us with him.\" Everyone \nfeared for their own lives. What could I do? I went out into the entryway and \nstood. And he says, \"any other time I would keep you here a year, or two. But \nright now, I'm sorry . . . \" Then another door opened, also on the third \nfloor. I ask the neighbor, \"Tayara, can we hide at your place?\" She's an \nAzerbaijani too. She says, \"What kind of question is that? Come in!\" She hid \nus. There were many people in the courtyard, and Gaya and I hid in the \nwardrobe, and they put Diana under a mattress, leaving a small opening so the \nchild could breathe. Tayara said that when the bandits left she would let us \nout, and when they came back she would hide us again.\n\nWe sat in the wardrobe for about a half hour. Gaya became ill, and I allowed \nher to get out. My legs fell asleep and felt like cannons. We hadn't eaten or \ndrunk anything for so long, since the 27th, when we saw that horror--and all \nof it just snapped in me. Tayara's husband went outside, even though I begged \nhim to stay, saying there should be a man in the house. He said that he'd be \nin the courtyard, and if anything happened his wife would signal him. She put \nher passport and all of their documents on the table so if they suddenly came \nin she could show them that they were an Azerbaijani family. My girls went to \nthe window--and what was going on out there! I feared for my children, that \nsomeone would recognize them from the street. Gaya let her hair down and put \non a scarf so she would resemble an Azerbaijani, but directly across there was\na 9-story building, their windows were right across from us, and I shouted \nthat someone would see her and give us away on the spot. But she kept on \nlooking.\n\n-Diana: I watched too.\n\n-Zinaida: Downstairs the bandits were fighting with the soldiers. The soldiers\ndidn't shoot, they didn't have orders to. I saw them throwing rocks at\nthe soldiers, they were young boys, 18- and 19-year olds, and they defended\nthemselves . . . I'm a mother after all, and they were no different from my\nchildren. When one of the soldiers fell and his head started bleeding I had to\nstop looking, l couldn't watch anymore . . . I imagined my children in their\nshoes . . .\n\n-Gayane: The troops had assumed their defense that morning and had cordoned \noff the buildings, and some of the soldiers surrounded the bus station, Block \n36, and our Microdistrict 3. But they only cordoned them off from the outside.\nThe mob fell upon the soldiers, who started to protect themselves, and the mob\nsurged into the courtyard with the soldiers after it. They caught several \nAzerbaijanis and started beating them with their clubs. One fell down and they\ncracked open another's head . . .\n\n-Zinaida: They show Lebanon on television, and the war in Afghanistan--that's just\nwhat it was like. Like in America, how they attack demonstrations with shields\nand clubs--that's just how it was in our courtyard.\n\n-Gayane: Don't compare it with America, those were peaceful demonstrations, \nbut these?!\n\n-Zinaida: But how could it happen here and not off somewhere in America! They \nattacked the soldiers, hurled stones at them . . . Then I thought, where's the\ntear gas that the Americans use to disperse demonstrators? If they had used \ngas on those jackals they all would have scattered.\n\n-Gayane: They would not have scattered. The soldiers had been there since \nmorning, they didn't bring in fresh troops. They hadn't eaten, they were fine \nstanding there for about three hours, but then they got tired. They weren't \neven allowed to sit down . . . At noon they, the soldiers, attacked them, and \nthen the tables were turned. The mob went after the soldiers, the guys were \nbunched into a group in the center street and covered themselves with their \nshields, and the Azerbaijanis surrounded them and threw paving stones at them.\nAnd those guys sat there covering themselves with their shields. And meanwhile\ntanks with machine guns were cruising the streets . . . They always say, \"Our \nchildren have never seen war.\" I never even dreamed about it, there was no \nneed to. But then I thought about those people who had lived through a war. It\nwas truly horrible . . . The guys were tired, exhausted, some had had their \nclubs taken away, others, their shields, they had been beaten, they were \ncovered in blood . . . so many died! They beat the soldiers with their own \nclubs and shields. And those guys stood there and couldn't defend themselves, \nthey couldn't open fire. They couldn't even defend themselves, let alone us. \nIt's comical . . .\n\n-Zinaida: What are you saying? How can it be funny?\n\n-Gayane: No, I didn't mean that: How could something like that happen during \nour Soviet period? It's painfully embarrassing! And they burned the armored \npersonnel carriers, too. Someone shouted, \"Get away, it's going to blow!\" \nEveryone scattered away, and the armored personnel carrier exploded. The \nsoldiers lost their senses. And when they drove the personnel carrier and the \nbus at the mob out of rage and fury, they drove right up on the sidewalk.\n\n-Zinaida: The bus that had brought the troops. Only the driver was in it. The \nbus ran over three people straight off, I saw it. And two armored personnel \ncarriers ran over four more. All in one or two minutes. The bus ran over \nthree, one of the carriers ran over two, and the second, two more. Right on \nour street there's a dry cleaners and appliance and watch repair places; one \nof the armored personnel carriers went that way, and they say it ran over\nseveral over there, too. But they ran over seven before our eyes. Then the bus\nploughed into a book kiosk.\n\n-Gayane: No, that was a flower place. It was a new booth. He drove straight \ninto it.\n\n-Zinaida: The driver jumped out and they dragged the vehicle out to the\nmiddle of the road and set it on fire.\n\n-Gayane: And I also saw the troops put a bunch of Azerbaijanis in a bus and \ntake them in a convoy to Baku. There were many arrests.\n\n-Zinaida: Our neighbor, the one who hid us, couldn't take it, and he told his \nwife that we should leave. They were running around in the courtyard looking \nfor the Armenians. They knew that they were hiding with Azerbaijanis, and they\nwere saying that they were going to check the Azerbaijani families. Poor \nTayara got scared too, and started to cry; I pleaded with her, I said that I \nwould remember forever how she saved my children and me, but where could we \ngo?\n\n-Gayane: She didn't make us leave, she said that she would do anything, but \nshe was afraid.\n\n-Zinaida: I told Tayara that we would just stay a little longer and that at\nnight we would return to our apartment. Then her husband came back and said \nthat a curfew had been imposed. He says, \"Zina, you owe us a drink. Gorbachev \nannounced a curfew.\" And Bagirov [First Secretary of the Communist Party of \nAzerbaijan SSR] was on television, he said that two people had been killed in \nKarabagh, but nothing was wrong, automobile windows had been broken, but there\nhadn't been any killings. He kept making statements, and there were \nAzerbaijani songs and dances. Tayara turned the TV all the way up. When we \nlearned of the curfew we calmed down, but then a crowd ran into the courtyard \nagain, a large one. Our neighbor told them that there had been only one \nArmenian family here, but they had already killed them all, there was no one \nleft. We hid in the wardrobe again. and they stuck Diana back under the bed.\n\n-Gayane: Tayara went down to our apartment to see what was happened there, and\nfound two bandits. They asked her, \"What are you doing here\" Tayara answered, \n\"I came to take something for myself.\" \"Take all you want, they're gone now.\" \n\n-Zinaida: Yes, she had wanted to get something for us, at least some bedding. \nShe said, \"What are you going to do, empty handed, naked, with three children,\nnothing remains of your entire apartment.\" In short, we calmed down, and the \ncrowd raced off to the other building, the one across from us. I don't know \nwhat went on there.\n\n-Gayane: The curfew had its effect on the gangs, many started to disperse:\nthey were warned that they would open fire on them. The soldiers didn't know \nthe city, they couldn't get oriented, they drove up and down the main streets,\nbut didn't go into the courtyards. When we were at the City Party Committee \nthey asked people from Sumgait to go with them and show them the way.\n\n-Zinaida: The tanks entered the city on the night of the 29th.\n\n-Gayane: No, Mamma, the tanks had been there earlier, but were near the City \nParty Committee, where the Armenians were . . . After midnight, on March 1, \nwhen I had finally gotten to sleep after two sleepless nights, Mamma said, \n\"Get your things together, they have sent buses for us.\" As it was we had been\ndressed the entire time. Mamma went to check it out . . .and came back for us.\n\n-Zinaida: When I came back for the children Tayara said that Vika was alive \nand well, some guys had come and told her that they had hidden her in a safe \nplace. I both believed it and didn't believe it. We ran out to the tanks. The \nGambarians were there, Roman and Sasha; their father, Shurik, the clarinetist,\nwas killed, and their mother was there. Sasha came over and asked about the \ngirls. I was surprised, how did he know my girls? He said that he knew me and \nthe girls. Our neighbor himself went for Gaya and Diana and it seemed like he \nwas taking forever so I went after him. Another neighbor came out, Anna \nVasilyevna, a Russian: \"Zinochka, my dear, goodbye and good luck.\" She kissed \nDiana. They put us in the bus and the captain gave the order for us to be \ntaken to the City Party Committee. The bus wouldn't start, so they put us on \nanother one. It was pouring rain.\n\n-Diana: When they imposed the curfew there were many soldiers on the streets, \nand they all had clubs and shields. And when the Azerbaijanis attacked them, \nmany of the soldiers died. They threw paving stones--huge rocks--at the \nsoldiers. I saw this myself. The soldiers ran over those Azerbaijanis with the\ntanks. The soldiers saw that the Azerbaijanis were doing violence to people \nand they ran over them out of rage. We got scared and they hid me under a \nmattress and a blanket, and Gaya and Mamma crawled into the wardrobe. And they\nwere fighting right down there on the street . . . Near the building they were\nblowing up buses and tanks, and cars were burning, and there were many dead in\nthe courtyard. They drove without looking to see if it was a sidewalk or a \nstreet, they just drove, and the ones who didn't manage to get out of the way \nwere run over by the tanks. And when we left--it was evening, it was already \ndark--there were three buses, and one of them had soldiers in it. Mamma ran up\nand said, \"Get your clothes on, let's go.\" Gaya was wearing slippers, and I \nhad on my blue dress, but it was an old one. I was wearing my old jacket, my \nold dress, and slippers. And nothing else. Gaya had on a skirt, her Angora \nsweater, and slippers. It was raining hard, and there were puddles on the \nstreet. They gave Mamma an old coat because she was wearing a short-sleeved \ndress; she put it on and we ran out. We got onto the bus and I was hungry, one\nof the soldiers from Yerevan gave me rations and carried me from one bus to\nthe other in his arms. I gave him the little glass that remained from Vika's\ntrousseau, and he gave me his telephone number.\n\n-Gayane: In the bus there was a soldier with a shield sitting at every window.\nWe had to be ready for anything. They took us to the City Party Committee, let\nus out, and then took us into the City Party Committee building under armed \nguard. It was jammed with people and you couldn't breathe. We asked, \"Are \nthese all us? Armenians?\" They answered yes. We were surprised that there were\nso many Armenians in Sumgait. All those years we lived there and didn't know \nthere were so many Armenians, 18,000. We were struck by that, we had never \nnoticed. Going downstairs the next day I ran into the Secretary of the \nKomsomol from Vika's plant, the Khimprom. He said that Vika was alive and \nwell. When I told Mamma she of course calmed down some more. But you know, \nafter all that it was hard to believe anything, our faith in everything was \njust gone. She didn't believe it completely.\n\n-Zinaida: I didn't believe it because I had heard all kinds of things. When\nwe arrived at the City Party Committee we heard everything imaginable! It\nwas the fear of God. I saw many of our acquaintances, they were kissing each \nother and asking how their children and homes were. Many people already knew \nthat there had been a pogrom of our apartment. They had seen the broken \nwindows. I cried, saying that I didn't know where Vika was. One woman said \nthat they had taken two of her daughters and that she couldn't find one of \nthem; the other had been slashed all over. A second said that her husband and\nher son had been murdered. That was Nelli Aramian. She lived in Building 6 in \nour microdistrict. They killed her husband, Armo, and her son Artur. I heard \nso many things like that that I was already starting to lose touch; my \npatience had run dry waiting for my daughter. Later an Azerbaijani fellow came\nto me and said, Aunt Zina, Vika sent me, she's alive and well and hidden in a \nsafe place; if you want I'll call her there and you can speak with her. We \nwent downstairs to the first floor and he called Vika. I spoke with her, heard\nthe voice of my child. She had managed to survive in that hell. Then I started\nbegging that Azerbaijani to bring her to the City Party Committee. He tried to\ntalk me out of it: \"I'll bring her wherever you go, don't worry, I've looked \nafter her better than a brother does a sister.\" All the same I asked him to \nget her. He brought her and I calmed down. On the second day there was a \nmeeting with Demichev [Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the\nCommunist Party of the USSR,] and people started shouting. One shouted, \"Give \nme my son back!\", another yelled, \"Where is my daughter?!\", a third wanted her\nhusband . . . Bagirov  was there too, and he stood there blinking, not saying \nanything.\n\n-Gayane: When Demichev asked where we wanted to go, everyone shouted, \"To\nRussia!\" To be honest we were all frightened of Armenia, there were such wild \nrumors it was as though we were in a terrible dream, and no one wanted to go \nto Armenia. But he said that he couldn't evacuate 18,000 people to Russia and \nthat he would meet with everyone individually the next day and speak with \nthem. And he also said that today he was going to go look at all of our \napartments. On March 3 we went to the military barracks in the village of \nNasosny. We were taken care of marvelously by the military. They sent special \nflights of children right from there to Minvody, Yerevan, and Moscow. One \nwoman left for Moscow with a letter for Gorbachev and Gromyko.\n\n-Zinaida: The worst was truly behind us by then. Everything had passed, but \nthe pain will remain for our whole lives. It cannot be forgotten. Under no \ncircumstances should we, our children, or our grandchildren forget. Who will\nanswer for those who died? For our mothers, sisters, brother, sons and\ndaughters? Who will bear the responsibility? Who will wash away their blood? \nSomeone should be made to answer, and severely, so it has an effect on the \npeople that did with us as they pleased . . . It isn't over yet, now we live \nhere, in Armenia, protected, but the issue isn't resolved. We would like\nto stay in Armenia, in our homeland, so that all the Armenian people will be\nunited. Then we will be invincible. Armenians won't be scattered throughout \nthe Soviet Union, about the world, and if we're all together this won't happen\nagain. As a mother of three children, as a woman, as a sister, I ask Armenians\nto be united so that what happened in Sumgait will never happen again. Our \nhomeland . . .

Hopefully, you won't\nget flamed, either.\n\nYou will, however, be argued with.  I personally think that your project is\nbuilt on unsteady ground.\n\nFirst, I do not believe that there is any way to find an \"objective morality\". \nMorality and value are inherently subjective - they represent the beliefs of a\nperson or a group of people.  They can be widely held, perhaps even\noverwhelmingly held, but they are never and _can_ never be objective.\n\n\nSecond, I do not accept the assumptions that you make here.  If, as you say,\nyou are trying to be objective, then why accept a morality to begin with by\nusing the Christian Bible?  You're defeating your own purpose by doing so.\n \n\nThird, call me a pessimist, but you won't stop the flamage.  There will always\nbe people who pop upin alt.sex.* to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we\nall are.  Just out of curiosity, do alt.sex readers show up unprovoked in the\nreligion groups to tell you all that you are narrow-minded, censoring,\noverbearing totalitarianists?\n \n\nHm.  Let me provide an example.  Four people get together over dinner, to\ndiscuss morality: you, me, a rather conservative Moslem, and a sociopath.  I\nstart off by saying that I think it's immoral to force people to have sex with\nyou.  You agree, but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of\nyour own gender.  (Just a note: I really don't know your views on\nhomosexuality, I am just using this as a common view of morality for the\npurposes of this example.)  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to\nhave their faces uncovered.\n\nThe sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, but\nfeels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind. \n                                                                         \n\n\t(Evidence deleted)\n\nI'm not going to accept your evidence for this.

However, who is at blame is another question.\nIt seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions--\nrealizing the risks--is to blame.\n\n\nYes, but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing\nany raondom activity.  Presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally\nfrom the rest of society because of this.\n\n\nAnd I argue that our law system is a similar risk.  Perhaps an innocent\nperson will be punished someday, but we work to prevent this.  In fact,\nmany criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment\nof innocents.\n\n\nBut, such accidents are to be totally expected, given the numner of vehicals\non the road.  Again, the blame is on society.\n\n\nYes, but the state is not at fault in such a case.  The state can only do\nso much to prevent false witnesses.\n\n\nOkay, so this is what you call murder.  But, the question is whether or not\nall such \"murders\" are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human life\nis wrong, no matter what the circumstances?\n\n\nBut, this is basically how it works.  Society accepts the risk that an\ninnocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of\nsociety shares this blame.  And, most people's definitions of murder\ninclude some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an\nexecution, is it?\n\n\nMurder violates the golden rule.  Executions do not, because by allowing\nit at all, society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the\ninnocent victim is.\n\n\nReading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction\nwas moral or not.  But, in an objective system, only the absolute truth\nmatters, and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth.  That\nis, twelve members must be convinced of a truth.\n\n\nBut then, if we read the minds of these people, we would know that the\nconviction was unfair.\n\n\nYes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all\npossible information), we can't always determine the difference in our\nflawed system.

Most people seem willing to do this.\n\n\nWe must realize the consequences of all our actions.

You should\n generally *not* take rutin by itself, but take the whole bioflavonoid \n complex instead. If you don't (and there are some exceptions to that)\n you'll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency, which is the other\n major component of the bioflavonoid complex.\n I found out the hard way years ago when I recommended rutin, after it\n showed deficient in patients who were NOT deficient in hesperidin be-\n fore. A later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in \n hesperidin, which, from then on, made me always *add* bioflavonoids \n to anyone that had *very* low levels of rutin.\n Most of the time people are equally low in rutin *and* hesperidin, so\n there is really no reason to take rutin by itself, but use the whole\n bioflavonoid complex instead.\n\n I have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that \n they had been helped with hemorrhoids, varicose veins, chronic nose \n bleeds, aneurysms, gastro-intestinal bleeding (due to drugs), etc...\n One patient in desperation took a whole bottle (100's) in one day\n for his painful, bleeding hemorrhoids, without any ill effects.\n  \n They are also non-toxic in very high amounts, that's why they can\n be safely recommended. If you are allergic to citrus fruit (they are\n made from their peels), pine bark sources are available as well.\n\n About 90% of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency, \n with the average daily dosage needed being about 1 - 2,000mg.\n For major complaints, 4 - 6,000mg+/day is common.\n \n In case they cannot be taken, because of their size and taste (they\n are big, and they don't taste that great), a product made from pine \n bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite\n small and taste much better, however the cost is about seven times\n higher for the equivalent effect. One 25mg tablet of the pine bark\n extract gives you about the same effect as 1,000mg of bioflavonoids.\n The name for the pine bark product is 'Pycnogenol.'\n  \n   Some Canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are:\n \n   Quest.............1,000mg   big, bitter, not chewable\n   Swiss Herbal........600mg   smooth, easier swallowing \n   Jamieson............500mg   medium, bitter, chewable \n\n   SISU.................25mg   (Pycnogenol) small, easy swallowing\n \n   Give them a try and see what happens.....and good luck!\n\n   -- Ron Roth --\n =====================================================================\n --  Internet: rn.3228@rose.com  -  Rosenet: ron roth@rosehamilton  --\n\n *   \"Eating Radium has strange results,\"  Tom said brightly.", "label": 13}

{"text": "The primary problem in human nature is a \"fragmentation of being.\"\nHumans are in a state of tension, a tension of opposites. Good and\nevil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.\n\nThe Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of\nbeing. The warring opposites within us are a product of man's\nrebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of\nthe Scriptures.\n\nMan was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words\nof St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was\nthat God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the\nEastern Orthodox Church, this is called \"theosis,\" or \"deification.\"\n\nOne can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul,\nand body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture\nof the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs\nwas a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the\nCreator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God,\ntheir natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly\nirreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in\ntheir lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This\nis symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.\n\nThe beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it\nwere to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil,\nits paradisiac state would also be destroyed.\n\nWas it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of\ninnocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining\nof self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His\nmasterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?\n\nGod must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral\nvalue, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There\nis no other way to achieve union with God.\n\nJesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities.\nHe was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites,\nand making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God,\nnot in His essence, but in His energies.\n\nThe opposites is THE Christian problem.

{"text": "The FLYERS closed out the season last night with their 8th straight victory,\na 5-4 OT winner over the Hartford Whalers. The OT game winner came from Dimitri\nYushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS\nnever led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an\nNHL record 9th OT loss this season.\n\nRoster move:\n\nGord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill\n\nInjuries:\n\nRyan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.\n\nLines:\n\nEklund-Lindros-Recchi\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\nFaust-Acton-Brown\n\nGalley-Bowen\nYushkevich-Hawgood\nCarkner-Hynes\n\nDominic Roussel\n\nGame Summary:\n\nI didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts\nI didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by\na few things I did pick up:\n\nFirst Period:\n\tHartford, Nylander 10, 8:51\n\tPhiladelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp)\nPenalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda,\nHar (interference) 18:43\n\nSecond Period:\n\tHartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00\n\tPhiladelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09\n\tHartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38\nPenalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har\nmajor-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski,\nHar (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50\n\nThird Period:\n\tHartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)\n\tPhiladelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11\n\tPhiladelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38\nPenalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30\n\nOvertime:\n\tPhiladelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15.\nPenalties - None\n\nPower Play:\n\tPhiladelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4\n\nGoalies:\n\tPhiladelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)\n\tHartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)\n\nOn the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue\nline and Nylander stripped him and took off.\n\nThe Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.\n\nThe Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it\nended up behind the goalie.\n\nOn the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.\nThis is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if\nthey get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,\nGalley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of\nthem was the closest FLYER to the play.\n\nThat's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it\nwas that scored, much less how.\n\nFrom what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart\nasked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the\ngame. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised\nthat a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy \nSoderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season\nand, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.\nBut here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for\nnumber 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between\nhim and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????\n\nWhat? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...\n\n#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.\nThe difference between the team's record with him and without him is no\naccident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without\nRecchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric\nLindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey\nnext season.\n\n#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,\nand Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't\nplay a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family\nhas a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy\nSoderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again\nabout being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.\n\n#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season\nscoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player\nget as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.\nNot a tough choice.\n\nHonorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total\nwhich he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line\nthis year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the\ndefensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.\n\nDimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie\nmistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling\nthat with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up\nanything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman\nin years to come.\n\nGarry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some\nthings you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,\nhe certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his\nwishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive\ncontribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end\nwill make him a much more important part of the team next year.\n\nBrent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.\nBut consistency became a problem for him.\n\nA couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members:\n\nTom Misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange E-mail\naddresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer.\nIf you're interested, you can send him mail at:\n\natt!ACR.ORG!TMISNIK\n\nThe FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning\npercentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in\nPatrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in\nnext years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as\nmany goals as they allowed, 319.\n\nThe 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.\n\nI will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey\nNews that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have\nno other way of getting them.\n\nI hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have.

It has v.32bis for 14.4Kbps data / 9600 bps fax,\nv.42, v.42bis, and MNP5 for error-correction and data compression, so\nyou can get error-free links up to 57,600 bps on a conventional phone\nline.  They will \"fall back\" to any speed (down to 1200bps) and even\ndisable compression and error-correction if necessary in order to\nconnect with slower and older modems.\n\nIt has a 16550 buffered UART for better compatibility with\nmulti-tasking operating systems (Windows, OS/2, Unix, etc).\n\nThey use a patented technology called Optical Line Interface (OLI)\nwhich reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest and\ncleanest connection possible.\n\nThese modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime tech\nsupport (and the call is free, too) from AT&T.\n\nThey also include the lovely and talented QuickLink II for DOS and the\nNEW QuickLink II for Windows communications and fax software which\nwill let you conveniently sent faxes from any DOS or Windows\napplication just by printing.  The Windows version will send faxes of\nany font and can include graphics, etc.  The DOS version can fax\ngraphics and a limited set of fonts (I believe that there are 5 or so,\nas well as any HP Laser II resident fonts).\n\nI'm asking $210.00 for this modem (plus Utah tax).  This is at or\nbelow the prices of any other (reputable) manufacturer of an\nequivalent modem (including Zoom, US Robotics, etc).  And, it is\nbacked by a company that will never go away.\n\nThis price will include delivery if you live within 20 miles of\ndowntown SLC.  I can also arrange shipping, or you can stop by my home\nto pick it up.  (If you're concerned about installing an internal\nmodem, let me know and we can discuss an arrangement for including\ninstallation.)\n\nIf you're interested, please let me know.  This is an excellent modem\nat an excellent price (they normally list for ~$500 and retail for\nabout ~$300).

And me thinks if the US had not helped out\nthe Iraqis would have swallowed Saudi Arabia, too (or at \nleast the eastern oilfields).  And no Muslim country was doing\nmuch of anything to help liberate Kuwait and protect Saudi\nArabia; indeed, in some masses of citizens were demonstrating\nin favor of that butcher Saddam (who killed lotsa Muslims),\njust because he was killing, raping, and looting relatively\nrich Muslims and also thumbing his nose at the West.\n\nSo how would have *you* defended Saudi Arabia and rolled\nback the Iraqi invasion, were you in charge of Saudi Arabia???\n\n\nI think that it is a very good idea to not have governments have an\nofficial religion (de facto or de jure), because with human nature\nlike it is, the ambitious and not the pious will always be the\nones who rise to power.  There are just too many people in this\nworld (or any country) for the citizens to really know if a \nleader is really devout or if he is just a slick operator.\n\n\nYou make it sound like these guys are angels, Ilyess.  (In your\nclarinet posting you edited out some stuff; was it the following???)\nFriday's New York Times reported that this group definitely is\nmore conservative than even Sheikh Baz and his followers (who\nthink that the House of Saud does not rule the country conservatively\nenough).  The NYT reported that, besides complaining that the\ngovernment was not conservative enough, they have:\n\n\t- asserted that the (approx. 500,000) Shiites in the Kingdom\n\t  are apostates, a charge that under Saudi (and Islamic) law\n\t  brings the death penalty.  \n\n\t  Diplomatic guy (Sheikh bin Jibrin), isn't he Ilyess?\n\n\t- called for severe punishment of the 40 or so women who\n\t  drove in public a while back to protest the ban on\n\t  women driving.  The guy from the group who said this,\n\t  Abdelhamoud al-Toweijri, said that these women should\n\t  be fired from their jobs, jailed, and branded as\n\t  prostitutes.\n\n\t  Is this what you want to see happen, Ilyess?  I've\n\t  heard many Muslims say that the ban on women driving\n\t  has no basis in the Qur'an, the ahadith, etc.\n\t  Yet these folks not only like the ban, they want\n\t  these women falsely called prostitutes?  \n\n\t  If I were you, I'd choose my heroes wisely,\n\t  Ilyess, not just reflexively rally behind\n\t  anyone who hates anyone you hate.\n\n\t- say that women should not be allowed to work.\n\n\t- say that TV and radio are too immoral in the Kingdom.\n\nNow, the House of Saud is neither my least nor my most favorite government\non earth; I think they restrict religious and political reedom a lot, among\nother things.  I just think that the most likely replacements\nfor them are going to be a lot worse for the citizens of the country.\nBut I think the House of Saud is feeling the heat lately.  In the\nlast six months or so I've read there have been stepped up harassing\nby the muttawain (religious police---*not* government) of Western women\nnot fully veiled (something stupid for women to do, IMO, because it\nsends the wrong signals about your morality).  And I've read that\nthey've cracked down on the few, home-based expartiate religious\ngatherings, and even posted rewards in (government-owned) newspapers\noffering money for anyone who turns in a group of expartiates who\ndare worship in their homes or any other secret place. So the\ngovernment has grown even more intolerant to try to take some of\nthe wind out of the sails of the more-conservative opposition.\nAs unislamic as some of these things are, they're just a small\ntaste of what would happen if these guys overthrow the House of\nSaud, like they're trying to in the long run.\n\nIs this really what you (and Rached and others in the general\nwest-is-evil-zionists-rule-hate-west-or-you-are-a-puppet crowd)\nwant, Ilyess?\n", "label": 17}

{"text": "\nIf the clutch is in, then a large chunk of counter-rotating mass is not\nrotating.  Hence, at a light, reving makes it twist.

New GS bikes with the paralever shaft have\nalmost no shaft effect.\n\n\n\nIt's a question of how long you spend at low RPM and how much you need the\nextra light.

Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the \n          organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.  \n          They have other related publications, including the quarterly \n          journal \"RECIPROCITY\". \n\n          \n\n          Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background\n    \n               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer \n          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he \n          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in \n          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He \n          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE \n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \n    \n               Larson's lack of a fancy \"PH.D.\" degree might be one \n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \n          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider \n          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same \n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX \n          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, \n          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC \n          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. \n     \n               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally \n          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  \n          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER \n          researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in \n          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. \n    \n               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX \n          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking \n          for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been \n          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \n    \n               \"Modern physics\" does NOT explain the physical universe \n          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of \n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \n          agree.  And remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \n          \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED \n          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. \n    \n    \n               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, \n          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or \n          still is) President of Larson's organization, \"THE \n          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\", and Editor of \n          their quarterly Journal \"RECIPROCITY\".  He moved to \n          Minneapolis after retiring. \n    \n\n\n          \"Super Collider\" BOONDOGGLE!\n          \n               I am AGAINST contruction of the \"Superconducting Super \n          Collider\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS \n          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \"scientific\" \n          value. \n    \n               Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the \n          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist \n          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY \n          particles (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", ALLEGED \"quarks\", etc.) \n          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, \n          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are \n          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly \n          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible \n          with their environment. \n    \n               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a \n          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not \n          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE \n          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! \n    \n               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 \n          BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for \n          this WASTED money?! \n    \n     \n               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed \n          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some \n          kind of \"fire ants\" eating the insulation off underground \n          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water \n          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of \n          the \"Supercollider\"?! \n    \n          \n               Naming the \"Super Collider\" after Ronald Reagon, as \n          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be \n          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. \n      \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter\n          \n               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of \n          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more \n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \n          which Larson calls \"Unit Velocity\" and the \"Natural Datum\". \n     \n               In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of \n          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, \n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \n          other. \n      \n               In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical \n          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension \n          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our \n          MATERIAL half. \n       \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Relativity\n          \n               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury \n          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the \n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \n          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, \n          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \n          help \"prove\" Einstein's \"General Theory of Relativity\". \n    \n               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results \n          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \"General Relativity\" can, by \n          INSTEAD using \"SPECIAL Relativity\".  In one or more of his \n          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH \n          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. \n    \n               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \"General Relativity\" as another \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \"Special \n          Relativity\", including the parts about \"mass increases\" near \n          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on \n          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than \n          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, \n          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). \n     \n               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead \n          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured \n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \n          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low \n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \n          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. \n          [Larson often used the term \"COORDINATE TIME\" when writing \n          about this.] \n    \n     \n               In regard to \"mass increases\", it has been PROVEN in \n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \n          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is \n          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists \n          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory, \n          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is \n          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS \n          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  \n          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward \n          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of \n          the so-called \"Big Bang\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL \n          FANTASY). \n    \n                                    \n          \n          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\n\n               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \"THE UNIVERSE \n          OF MOTION\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific \n          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 \n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \n    \n               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL \n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that \n          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. \n    \n               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical \n          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and \n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of \n          the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\n          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white \n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \n    \n               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL \n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \n          OPEN MINDS! \n    \n               The following is an example of his Theory's success: \n          In his first book in 1959, \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL \n          UNIVERSE\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING \n          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding \n          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's \n          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he \n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \n    \n\n \n          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS\n\n               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \n          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were \n          originally thought to originate from \"neutron stars\" in the \n          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \n          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT \n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \n          directional coincidence). \n    \n               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by \n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of \n          his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", published in 1984, the \n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the \n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls \n          the \"Cosmic Sector\".  Because of the relationship between the \n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \n          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do \n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \n          directions uniformly.) \n    \n               I wonder how close to us in space a source location \n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \n          stop it! \n    \n               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which \n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \n          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! \n    \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\n          \n               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \n    \n               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY \n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of \n          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey \n          B. Larson. \n    \n               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is \n          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" \n          and in some of his other books. \n    \n               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate \n          energy by \"fusion\".  A small fraction comes from slow \n          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE \n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each \n          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \n          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal \n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \n          lighter elements. \n    \n               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the \n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I \n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron \n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \n          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some \n          of his books [better than I can]. \n    \n               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the \n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \n          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center \n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The \n          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and \n          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN \n          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. \n    \n               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \n          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown \n          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The \n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a \n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward \n          the \"MAIN SEQUENCE\" from opposite directions on the H-R \n          Diagram. \n    \n               The chances of the two masses falling back into the \n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \n          system, orbiting each other. \n     \n               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE \n          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the \n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \n          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron \n          stars\", \"black holes\", etc.. \n    \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\n\n               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \n          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single \n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \"mini\" white dwarf \n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected \n          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! \n      \n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all \n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive \n          his own version of Bode's Law. \n          \n\n\n          \"Black Hole\" FANTASY!\n\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently \n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \"black \n          holes\" merging together into a SINGLE \"black hole\", and \n          concluded that the new \"black hole\" would have MORE MASS than \n          the sum of the two original \"black holes\". \n    \n               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED \n          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \"black \n          holes\", etc.! \n    \n               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about \n          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe, especially his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", it is \n          clear to me that \"black holes\" are NOTHING more than \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is \n          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \"black \n          hole\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \n          to \"prove\" their theory. \n    \n    \n               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is \n          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and \n          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical \n          problem somehow makes him \"wiser\".  It does NOT! \n    \n               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist \n          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread \n          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's \n          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of \n          Unified Science). \n          \n          \n          \n          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION\n\n               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \n          with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to \n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \n    \n               I found a possible clue about why they might work on \n          pages 112-113 of the book \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\", by \n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of \n          Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe.  I quote one paragraph: \n    \n               \"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \n          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It \n          was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book \"NOTHING BUT \n          MOTION\"] that there are physical processes in operation which \n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \n          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of \n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged \n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open \n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \n          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the \n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \n          the progression of the natural reference system.  All \n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \n          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The \n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\" \n          \n               Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are \n          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a \n          particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning \n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).  \n          (\"Unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are \n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \n          according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the \"above\" and \n          \"below\" labels mixed up.] \n    \n               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\n          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \n          light! \n    \n               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION \n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a \n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \n          achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge \n          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular \n          frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) superimposed on the \n          rotation of the particle.) \n      \n               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to \n          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is \n          generated in clouds. \n\n\n\n          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics\n\n               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has \n          been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in \n          his first book \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\". \n    \n               It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan, \n          and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call \n          \"science\" (or \"physics\", or \"astronomy\", etc.), as well as \n          the \"scientific\" literature and the \"education\" systems, to \n          TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have. \n    \n               Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many \n          things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such \n          as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars. \n    \n               Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY \n          discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals, \n          in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles \n          of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses \n          at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and \n          elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a \n          worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed. \n    \n          \n\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (especially Larson's BOOKS). \n\n\n\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \n          IMPORTANT partial summary is ENCOURAGED. \n", "label": 14}

SCSI-2 is fully\n SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it \n needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be \n very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst \n {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst\n {32-bit/wide and fast}.

The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling\nprophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which\nin turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its\ncost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the\nRule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt\nthe cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}", "label": 3}

Since Christians citing the Bible in such a context\nshould be presumed to have at least READ the story, it amounts to slander\n-- a charge that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us.\n\n\nThe moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_\nin this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\nactivity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\n\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\nall \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\n\nHomosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I\nknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and\nchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly\n\"harmless\" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --\nthat would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter\nyou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that\nyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]\n\n\t\"'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything\n\tis for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one\n\twill not let anything make free with me.\"  [1 Cor. 6:12]\n\nWhich is a restatement that we must have no other \"god\" before God.  A\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary\nargument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.\n\nI won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are \"moral\" and\nwhich ones are \"ritual.\"  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\n\nI'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\nof the ritual law?\n\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\n\n\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\nyou can think of to do so.\n\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\nians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\nin return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\n\nChristians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\ncorner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\nold verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\neven read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\nthe vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\nmanage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\nemotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\ntaking the trouble to find out what it is.\n\nSuch behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\nWHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\ncondemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN\nto BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?\nGod forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or\ncondemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in\ninsisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are\nSO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.\n\nWhy, for God's sake?\n\n\t\"For God did not send the Son into the world\n\tto condemn the world,\n\tbut that the world might be saved through him.\n\tWhoever believes in him is not condemned,\n\tbut whoever does not believe has already been condemned\n\tfor refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son.\n\tNow the judgment is this:\n\tthe light has come into the world,\n\tbut men have preferred darkness to light\n\tbecause their deeds were evil.\n\tFor everyone who practices wickedness\n\thates the light,\n\tand does not come near the light\n\tfor fear his deeds will be exposed.\n\tBut he who acts in truth\n\tcomes into the light,\n\tso that it may be sh0own\n\tthat his deeds are done in God.\"\tJohn 3:17-21\n\nFor long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from\nevil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and\nrejected.  Some of us despaired and took to courses that probably *do*\nshow a sinful shunning of God's light.  Blessed are those whose spirits\nhave been crushed by the self-righteous; they shall be justified.\n\nHowever, we have seen the Truth, and the Truth is the light of humanity;\nand we now know that it is not WE who fear the light, but our enemies who\nfear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow\nit with the darkness of false witness against us.", "label": 15}

{"text": "\n\nWell, the best thing to do is to read the book \"Parallel Universes\"\nby Dr. Fred Wolf. \n\nIn essence, Dr. Wolf says that one interpretation of the sub-atomic\nparticle/wave duality is that what we perceive as a wave is actually\nan infinate number of parallel universes overlaid, and in each of\nthese universes there is a particle in a different location. When we\ndo something to make a particle \"appear,\" we are actually causing\nall the parallel universes to collapse into one. Apparently this is\none line of thought on the nature of QM, that is going through some\nof the scientific community.\n\nDr. Wolf (and many others) claim that somehow the collapse is caused\nby the mental effort of observing the particle. This implys that\nmind is more than merely a biological phenomenon. He then extrapolates\nthat if mind is an integral part of the universe, then perhaps consciousness\nis the element that gives order and form to the universe(s) it/themself(s).\n\nIt all gets rather interesting, but what I find facinating is that\nthis would explain the phenomenon of \"magick\" as practiced in my\nreligion. Dr. Wolf speculates that the ordering functionality of mind\ncould be caused by the selection of a future from an infinite number of\npossible futures; he says that this might be done by some sort of\ncommunication between ones current, and possible future selves. \nI have long speculated that if magick is not merely a form of self\ndelusion then perhaps it could be caused by some sort of a selection\nof one of many possible futures.\n\nI realize that this gets pretty bizarre, but it never hurts to keep \nan open mind and at least file it all away as another possibile \nexplaination of the world in which we find ourselves.

(Due to the prevailing assumption \nthat the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)\n\n  The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the \ndevelopment of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications \nof BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!\n\n  REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!\n\n  \n1\n  I dream like this: ether based reality\n \n  The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations \nstart as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices\nboth drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it, \nconverting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy. \n(non-spinning lattice = \"dark matter\")\n\n  The earth isn't exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image \nof a galaxy; we haven't any videos of them spinning. Picture us \nbeing stationary, and the sun's image being dragged across the sky by \nthe spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is \nspinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner \nkernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a \nfaster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground \nof the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but \nits \"foot print\" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])\n  \n  The moon isn't exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self \nspin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth's ether field, which is \nitself in the sun's much more powerful field. Our seasons are the \nwobble of earth's axis, like a top slowing down. The \"orbit\" of the\nearth around the sun is all of the stars' images being dragged around\nby the sun's ether feild.\n\n  The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and \"distance\" \napart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because \nthe \"path\" is not the same. The moon's lattice in the ether is like \nsticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half \nturn. The sun's lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has \ngot the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to \nthe moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a \"j\" hook at \nthe end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the \nwhole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there. \n\n  With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon \ncan be about as big as \"earth's\" shadow upon it, and at other times \ntotally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge, \nwould you guess that they are about the same size, just because they \nlook about the same size?\n\n   O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S\n E       /     \\            \n    M    |      |      OR                M    \n         \\ _ _ /                         \n       S                           \n       \n  The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate\nof ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating \"turntable view\" \nof the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I've seen a \nhalf moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the \nday. Try and draw that \"earth shadow.\") Its only the moon's image \nwhich appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is \nthe part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away \nfrom the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.\n\n  \"Light-Years\" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is \ncloser to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase \nof reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. \n(defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be \nessentially happening now. The \"piece\" of light may have experienced \nmany years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.\n\n  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to \nde-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design \na propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like \ntrying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)\n\n  To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I'd \nlook in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just \nmight carry decipherable data. I'd start looking on some part of the \nspectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+ \nbillion humans?) I'd totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG \nbackwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card \nfor Pentium!)\n\n  Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound \nmedia, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I \nwould try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which \nI'd start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole. \n[Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a \ntwo foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I \ncould get with my machine's receiver next to it.  \n\n  If you don't think you'll live to see it, consider this: QUIT \nPUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of \nlife's data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our \nthoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By \neating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant \ninstructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or \nbiblical guys did live hundreds of years. I'm curios to see what \nthey did and ate. Don't worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we \ndon't need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and \nthat is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where \ndid the household concept 'immortal' come from? Wheat is a weed, it \nis programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then \ndie)\n\n  Warning about writing to the past:\nI had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel \nfuture, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from. \nThere were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an \nOscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us, \nand then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the \nothers into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by \n\"advising\" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into \nreproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that \nthe little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to \nprovide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it \nin his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his \ncontrol. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying \nthat there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve \nsouls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was \nfinite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in \nour reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it \nseemed odd, but we couldn't remember how else it should be. Then \nsome of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no \nmore, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped \nthrough his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that \nhe had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body, \nexisting only on the wind. \n\n  MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls \nwhose will's are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat \nothers as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a \nlonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for \nplaymates. (its not eternal, there's more than one way back) \n\n Accepting rides to the past:\nOnce here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a \nPrince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go \nahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry. \nI Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes \nyour work, but thinks you're getting wise, he can direct you to cross \npaths with your old self, and you'll vanish as you rewrite your own \ncourse of history, none the wiser.\n\n  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped \nback in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still \nmake changes while he's here, its just that that is work, and with \nevery 'adjustment', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which \nloosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. \nBut he can't see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had \nto apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand \nto retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers. \n\n  How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country, \nour money, and they're spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this: \nWashington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to \ncongress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks \nare making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big \ncorporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the \nbanks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but \nmostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14 \nhours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time \nto buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If \nwe are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if \nthe point is just to keep the people busy making widgets? \n\n  In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, \"its chaos!\" They \nsaid, \"no, its order.\" He defined chaos as that which is he was not \nable to control.\n\n  Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy \nwould hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no \nlanguage. (telepathic; and 'vanishing' the closest knowledge of death)\n(think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and \npointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably \nnaive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should \nbe able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about. \nThey can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers \nmight have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a \ndifferent frequency than us as they aren't eating seeds.\n\n  Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a \nhuge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat \nonly fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and \nneed a lot less sleep.\n\n  UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The \ntroops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill \neach other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)\n\n  Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot \ntall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they \nsuck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that \nthey aren't dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life. \n\n  Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women \nand children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut \nfrom the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think \nthat there may be some very interesting results to this, such as \nmother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples \nof this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.\n\n  That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He \ntells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which \nthe people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He'll \nplay a poker face up until he thinks he's cornered, and then he'll \nwhine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you're willing to \nlive on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was \nright, and he didn't over play his hand, and he won't need to go \nback and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over \nyour destiny, just don't live along a path that leads to a reality \nin which you don't want to be a part of. ", "label": 14}

If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor.\"\n\nWhy would I want an eternal life if I hate this one?\n\nIf we were created by a deity, why would that deity not wish us to\nenjoy what he has given us?\n\nWhy would I want to live forever?  The challenge in my life is that I\nwill die, and that I must give my life the meaning I wish it to have\nbefore that happens.  My time is here and will someday pass; I will be\ncontent to live on in the memories of my friends, and once they too\nare dead, then I will no longer have any reason to exist.\n\nIn short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn't automatically\nmean that I would worship it.  I am content to live my own life, and\nfend for myself, so when I die, I can be proud of the fact that no\nmatter where I end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices.\n\nIf your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so be\nit.  I would much rather just cease to exist.  But if your god wants\nmy respect and my obedience, then it had better earn these; and if it\ndoes, then they will be very strong and true.\n\n\nJesus wasn't the only one who rose from the dead -- I think it was\nOsiris who did the same, as well as a few characters from Greek or\nNorse legend, if memory serves.\n\nBut still: WHY would I want to rise from the dead?  Why do *you* want to?\n\n\nIf your god wants to win my devotion, then it knows what it can do --\nprovide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind\nfaith that could be applied equally well to any religion.\n\n\nThat's precisely it.  I neither see nor know Zeus either, nor Odin.\nShall I offer them the same devotion I offer Jesus?\n\n\nYou've got to understand my point-of-view: I see Christians spouting\nBible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that\nwill level all opposition.  Truth is, it's not.  Robert has never\ndemonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; he\njust rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face of\ncommon sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.\n\nBut even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain the\nverses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view,\nwhich is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only\nhe or she understood the Christian message properly, and then all\nstrife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here's the problem with\nthat: substitute \"Moslem\" or \"Buddhist\" or \"Satanist\" instead of\n\"Christian\", and it means the same thing.\n\nChristanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.  But if\nyou want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD,\nyou've got some convincing to do.\n\n\nAnd in my opinion, you're bumbling about blindly making up entities\nwhere there aren't any, and depriving yourself of a true understanding\nand enjoyment of your life.

{"text": "For those of you who are thinking about fiamms, you might also want to think\nabout airhorns. I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from \nDennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated\nat 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to\nthe relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay\npins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used\na crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.\n\tI installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front\nfairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube\nframe used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to\ndo this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two\nvertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing\nfollows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing.\nThe compressor is about 2\" in diameter and about 5\" long.\n\tThe relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small\nso there should be plenty of good places for it.\n\tI found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to\nmount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side\njust in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the\nhorns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where\nthe gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough\nroom to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice\ncut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.\n\tThe short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out\nabout an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look\nclosely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight\nahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).\n\tIf you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try\nto explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them\nfirst.\n\tHow do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound\nmore like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock.\nI have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has\nnot blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).\n\tI've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though\nthey know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping\nthe pedestrians on the sidewalk.\nThe bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to\nthose stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives)\nand are relatively easy to install on the FJ.

We ran into one of my relatives at the \nbus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away,\nnear the store. Well at first we didn't know what was happening, and then a\nfellow I know comes up to me, an Azerbaijani guy, and says, \"What are you\nstanding here for? Go home immediately!\" I asked, \"What's going on?\" He says, \n\"What's the matter, can't you see, they've overturned a car and they're \nkilling Armenians!\" He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely.\n\nWe sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our \ncourtyard. But the neighbors wouldn't let them in the building. There were \nabout 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. They\nwere shouting something, but you couldn't understand it. It wasn't one voice \nor two, all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35.\nThey went up to the third _floor, and we see that they're breaking glass and \nthrowing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway: one \nhas a pair of jeans in his hands, another has a tape recorder, and a third a \nguitar. They went on toward the auto parts store.\n\nWe had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School \nNo. 33, which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families \nthere with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only \nknown Ernest before, he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani \nguard at the school let us in. At first he didn't want to, but there was \nnowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We \nwere told that on that day, the 1st, there would be an attack on our \nmicrodistrict.\n\nWe went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor.\n\nOn the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be\nused to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of \nthem and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. I\nasked him for assistance. I say, \"We're in School No. 33, we need to be \nevacuated.\" Well he says, \"Got it, wait there, I'm sending out help now.\"\n\nI know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant, I had spoken with\nhim personally. When I called he said, \"Muslimzade here.\"\n\nAbout two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked out\nthe window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying, \"Armenians, come \nout, we're here to get you.\" They have clubs, axes, and armature shafts in \ntheir hands. The guard sat there with us, and asked, \"Where should I go?\" I \nsay, \"If your life is of any value to you you'll go down there and say that \nthe Armenians were here and that they left.\" That's what he did. He went down \nthere and said, \"The Armenians were here,\" he said, \"I let them out the back \ndoor, they went that way.\" And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and \nnoise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed.\n\nSo the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help, all right!\nInstead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive that\nMuslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school, no one knew that \nwe were there. In any case, we stayed at the school until seven in the \nmorning, and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid.\n\nIn the morning we went to my relative's in Microdistrict 1, and the soldiers \ntook us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people, and there \nwere lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. One small boy, \nabout three months old, died right in my arms. There wasn't a single doctor, \nnothing. The boy was uninjured, there were no wounds or bruises on him. He was\njust very ill. They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, they did everything\nthey could under the circumstances, but were unable to save him. And his \nmother and father, a young Armenian couple, were right there, on the floor ...\n\nI searched for a spot for us in the SK, we have a small child of our own, I\nwanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the third\nfloor, there were a lot of soldiers up there, bandaged, with canes, limping, \nwith their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys, all of \nthem.\n\nThere were a lot of bandaged Armenians, too. Everyone had been beaten, \neveryone was crying, wailing, and calling for help. I think that the City\nParty Committee ignored us completely. True, there was a snack bar: a sausage \nwas 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks, a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being\nsold for 50, a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to \nget the things any cheaper.\n\nI met my old uncle, Aram Mikhailovich, there. He saw me and tears welled up in\nhis eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples, that we \nworked together, he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house. And now he saw \nme and there was nothing he could say, he just cried.

(Sweet.)\"\n\np. 203 (second paragraph).\n\n\"One evening I passed through what had been a Tartar village. Among the \n ruins a fire was burning. I went to the fire and saw seated about\n it a group of soldiers. Among them were two Tartar girls, mere children.\n The girls were crouched on the ground, crying softly with suppressed\n sobs. Lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and\n other furnishings of Tartar peasant homes. There were also bodies of the\n dead.\"\n\np. 204 (first paragraph).\n\n\"I was soon asleep. In the night I was awakened by the persistent crying of\n a child. I arose and went to investigate. A full moon enabled me to make\n my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy\n that had been enacted. Guided by the child's crying, I entered the yard of\n a house, which I judged from its appearance must have been the home of a\n Turkish family. There in a corner of the yard I found a women dead. Her\n throat had been cut. Lying on her breast was a small child, a girl about a\n year old.\"\n\np. 118.\n\n\"Slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow, the cart\n jolting and the loads swaying. Boys ran along the line of oxen, encouraging\n them with shrill Tartar cries, and belaboring the beasts with sticks. In the\n carts, the women, veiled as is the Tartar way, held children in their arms.\n Wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they\n sought protection from the wind and cold. A few old men plodded along on foot.\n\n Across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown. The leading\n oxteam reached this barrier and halted. The gunmen and other ruffians \n concealed among the rocks opened fire. Women and children leaped and\n scrambled from the carts, screamed, ran and sought vainly for safety.\n\n This massacre was not complete. The Armenian soldiers in the near-by \n barracks, hearing the firing and the turmoil, hurried to the scene....\n That same day the abandoned Tartar quarter of Alexandropol was looted\n and completely destroyed.\"\n\np. 192.\n\n\"Great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding-places on the\n retreat of the Turks followed our army as it advanced.... They entered\n into the city with the army and immediately began plundering the stores\n that had been left by the Turks.\"\n\np. 193.\n\n\"Terrible vengeance was taken upon Tartars, Kurds and Turks. Their villages\n were destroyed and they themselves were slain or driven out of the country.\"\n\np. 195.\n\n\"The fanatical Dashnacks hated the Turks above all others and then in order\n of diminishing intensity: Tartars, Kurds and Russians.\" \n\np. 218.

They had been as helpless\n and as defenseless as sheep. They had not died as soldiers die in the\n heat of battle, fired with ardor and courage, with weapons in their hands,\n and exchanging blow for blow.

During our retreat to Karaklis two thousand of\n these poor devils were cruelly put to death. I was sickened by the\n brutality displayed, but could not make any effective protest. Some,\n mercifully, were shot. Many of them were burned to death. The method\n employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut, and then after\n crowding the hut with Turks, set fire to the straw.\"\n\np. 19 (first paragraph)\n\n\"The Tartar section of the town no longer existed, except as a pile of\n ruins.

{"text": "\nOur doctors' monopoly is exactly the same as in the U.S., if not\nmore powerful now that they can dictate insurance payment rates,\nbut I don't know an answer to this one.  Anecdotally, my friends\nwho are MD's (including my main buds from high school) talk about\nhow hard it is to turn \"state's witness\" against someone else ...\nno direct experience there, though.\n\n\nWell, what American private insurance plans cover travel expenses???\n\nSince our public insurance plans are publicly accountable, one can\nraise a stink in the media to try and extort benefits beyond which\none is entitled (hey, not Alberta's fault that he lives there) ... \nIf he lived in Cheyenne, WY his private insurance would've told him\nto go to hell for the travel expenses and that's that.  An HMO would\nhave just kept quiet and let him go blind.\n\n\nI don't think that this has been shown with the DMC ...\n\n\nIt's regular practice in a hospital to figure out who needs to get\nat what facilities.  Don't Americans have to arrange in advance for\noperations too?  I think that there are two standards being applied\nhere, and that Canada can't give Beverly Hills-style treatment to\neverybody.  It's not a big brother list ... it's more like calling\naround town for a table for dinner ...\n\n\nYes, and the Tories in Ottawa are trying to make them do that rather\nthan hope for a bigger grant from the feds and their province the \nnext time around.  Whether it's using mop a couple of weeks longer\nor even selling services to Americans (remember, our system is cash\nbased and since our health care infrastructure is overbuilt except\nin specialties that require larger populations to generate business,\nwhy not?  The alternative is closing unused wards ... business.).\n\n\nYou answered the question yourself ... \"private nonprofit foundations\nhave to make money somehow\", and I think that it's about time that\nthey acted like the private hospitals that they are.  Personally,\nI'm fed up with Canadian socialists trying to tell everyone that\ntheir health care is free when we are actually buying insurance\n(that's one at you, Bob Rae!!).\n\n\nSince we have always been evaluated in an OECD style, I don't see\nhow ... remember, OECD counts both private and public funds, and\nin Canada like France and Germany, 30% of health care spending is\nprivate funds (i.e., not the basic health insurance money).\n\n\nMinor copayments can flush out abusers.  Remember that our \"system\"\nis only an insurance policy.  But our costs aren't rising fast\nenough to ensure adequate copayments/deductibles ... last year,\nQuebec's user-fee proposal came out with the number of \"$5\" as\nthe necessary hike that could be done through a copayment rather\nthan give the QMA a raise.  And it's not contract time yet, as\nfar as I can tell from UPI Clarinet ...\n\nEven the new Reform Party, a breakoff of traditionalists from the\nConservatives with a mildly \"libertarian\" faction, holds our public\nhealth insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to\nbe reminded that it's not free (the average Canadian/European is more\nfiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these).\nBut no mention of copayments anywhere to be seen ... but cutting public\nspending all over the place, and bringing back the death penalty, with\nlittle haste if elected.\n\n\nSorry! (-;  It's just that I even run into people from Buffalo\nand from Michigan who don't know ...\n\n\nYeah, but there'd be a lot of lead-time and a health-care crisis that\nwould preclude it.  If provincial governments (as bad as some of them\nare; heck, we have the NDP cleaning up a spending mess made by the\nConservatives in Saskatchewan - embarassing!) can be so irresponsible,\nthere is still reallocation --- health insurance is so important that\nit's about the only thing that can inspire open rebellion and violent\ninsurrection outside of the hockey rink.  Right now, attempts to get\nthe system and its users to learn good habits are being treated like\ncod-liver oil ...\n\n\nMost Americans are fearful of a single-tier system ... (-;\n\nSeriously, there are few areas that have sufficient population for a\ntwo/more-tiered system like what the French have ... a health policy\nprof, D.G. Shea, has cited studies in the NEJM that indicate having\na population of 500,000 is necessary for adequate competition ...\nand in Canada, there are only four cities west of the Great Lakes\nwith that population or larger.\n\nAnyways, the numbers show that costs have held steadier than those\nin the U.S. and barring any future Chernobyl-like crisis, sudden\ntransients in spending are unlikely.  In fact, the health allocation\nis one of the most well-behaved sectors of spending up north so any\ntalk of bankruptcy is talk-radio fodder far away from the border.\n\n\nThis won't be overnight, and something like this would force Canada\nto have a system more like the French one ... but that's not a bad\nthing, and the change will be minimal (i.e., add copayments and\nfrustrate the socialists chanting \"Hey, it's *free*!\").\n\ngld", "label": 18}

{"text": "\nI'd like to field this one, if I may.  Although I am a believer in and follower\nof Christ, my experiences with religion haven't been all that positive.  In\nfact, there was one point in my life when, for about three days, I simply\n_couldn't_ believe in the existence of God.  Anyway, when I look back upon the\ntroubles I've had, they seem to fall into two categories -- impulses to\nunbelief that resulted from logical contradictions, and impulses to unbelief\nthat resulted from frustration with God.\n\nThe first category doesn't occur to me much anymore, as I have worked through\nmost of the arguments for the non-existence of God.  But way back when, these\nwould cause me some problems, and I would have to struggle with my faith to\ncontinue to believe.  I can see where others less stubborn than I (and I do\nmean stubborn.  Stubborness has often been the only thing standing between\nme an atheism from time to time) would fail.\n\nThe second category arises out of some long-term personal difficulties and\nthe struggle to live my life as God would have me live it WITHOUT living my \nlife as others would tell me how God would have me live it.  A good example of\nthis is my struggle with the more radical Christians I meet.  I am not, nor\nhave I ever been, \"on fire for Chirst,\" and I don't think I ever want to be.\nNevertheless, I am not \"lukewarm\" about my faith, so I don't really\nfit in with the mainstream either.  Quite naturally, I feel a lot of anxiety\nabout my dislocation within Christian society, and it can lead to a lot of\ninternal tension, when I want to do what I _know_ is right,\nbut when another part of me believes that what I want to do is wrong because\nall the other Christians think so to.  Quite naturally, this tension has a\ndestructive effect on my relationship with God, and during all of this internal\nstrife, there's atheism sitting there like the promised land -- no rules, no\nresponsibilities, no need to live up to anyone's expectations but my own.\nComplete freedom.  Of course, it's all an illusion, but nevertheless, it's a\nvery appealing illusion, especially when the so-called \"people of God\" are\nbehaving like total twits.  I can easily understand why someone would go\nthat route, and would be hostile to ever coming back.\n\nIMHO, many of the former-Christians-turned-atheists-who-are-now-actively-\nhostile-to-Christianity are so because their experience with Christ and God\nwasn't a very peaceful one, but one of mind-control and \"shut-up-and-do-what-\nyou're-told-because-we-know-what's-best-for-you-because-it's-God's-will-and-\nyou're-to-young-to-know-what-God's-will-is-yet\" courtesy of some of Christ's\nmore overzealous followers.  \n\nA final reason why people become atheists is because Christians do not have a\nvery good reputation right now.  One of the things that attracted people to\nChristianity in the ancient days was the love that Christians obviously had\nfor one another and the world around them.  Unlike the rest of the world,\nChristian communities actively cared for their poor, and the Christian rich\ndid not trod on the backs of their poorer brothers, but bent down to help\nthem.  Christians were known for living exemplary lives, even if they were\nthought to be traitors to the state because they wouldn't sacrifice to the\nemporer.  Nowadays, courtesy of the media and some Christian leaders who lost\nChrist on their way to power, people see Christians as sexually-repressed\nhippocritical busibodies who want to remake society into a facist version of \ntheir own moral view.\n\nThere are a lot more reasons why people become atheists, but I don't have time\nto go into them right now.\n\n", "label": 15}
{"text": "REPOST - DUE TO NET PROBLEMS\n\nHi,\n   I have problems with the FDHD on a IICX that EKG reports is ROM\nrevision 376. I had reports that this Mac was having trouble \nformatting disks and by the time I got to it, the FDHD just would\nnot respond although all other functions were fine.\n\nI checked the voltages on the DB19 external drive connector and pin\n6 showed no volts with 7 and 8 giving 25volts unloaded. The power \nsupply is an Astec and I sent it away for repair.\n\nWith the power supply reinstalled, I now get the following error:\n\nWith the internal FDHD connected, the Mac boots fine but on completion\nof boot cycle an alert displays \"The disk is unreadable - do you\nwant to eject it?\". For every combination of response, the alert \nreappears within approx 2 seconds and this error is continuous. The\nFDHD does spin but there is no head seeking and the FDHD is incapable\nof ejecting the disk. This error sequence occurs regardless of whether\nthere is a floppy in the drive or not. Pin 6 on the DB19 external \nconnector shows 1.2V, pins 7 and 8 show 10.75V.\n\nWith the internal FDHD disconnected, the Mac boots fine and works great \n(MacEKG reports no errors). The DB19 external connector now shows\nno voltage on pin 6 but pins 7 and 8 show 10.75V.\n\nNow, the internal FDHD may be fubar, but I have an apple 800K external\ndrive that gives exactly the same symptoms as the internal drive when\nconnected to either the external DB19 or the internal connector at J16\n(after suitable surgery to the external drive).

Models that do not match up with what he knows he\nfeels will be discarded.

Anyway...)\n\n\tThe basis for our (the catholic church's) belief in the assumption of\nMary, body and soul, into heaven is that, to put it simply, the apostles \nand all the early generation Christians believed it.  In fact, throughout their\nministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary, and 11 of the 12 were\npresent when she died.  Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several days\nlater, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several of\nthe other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal was\nstill unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  There\nwas no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else\nwas laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believed\nthat Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their  \npreaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently \nconsidered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behind\nby several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by the\napostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written down\nin the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that the\nauthenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.  At least in the case of\nthe assumption of Mary, the authenticity is quite clear.", "label": 15}

{"text": "\nWhen you buy insurance where you live, it is based on the local rates.\nTourists coming from, say, Utah will find that there is a difference\nin what their insurance will cover FOB Provo and what they get stuck\nwith at Lenox Hill or Mount Sinai if they fall ill in the Big Apple.\n\n\nIt would depend on where you live, downtown Toronto or Mile 101,\nBritish Columbia (just like Cheyenne, WY vs. Boston, MA).  Again,\ngeography rears its ugly head.\n\nSince our health care providers are private, they depend on an\nadequate market size in order to sustain enough business.  Since\nour health care professionals have equivalent take-home pay to \ntheir American cousins, it's not that they're being paid too\nlittle to provide services.\n\n\nI have only hear Americans say that it's illegal ... but I could be\nwrong, just have never heard it from a Canadian source.  our private\ninsurance has recently balked in Quebec when the Liberals proposed\nprivatizing some aspects of routine care ... also, our insurance was\nput in place when no NDP (Labour) governments were in power in any\nprovince to derail the effort 'cos they wanted real socialized\nmedicine.\n\n\nNo, it is optional ... as it is optional for doctors to accept it.\nThere are isolated religeous communities in particular that ask for\nexemptions (and one e-mail from a Christian Scientist in Edmonton\nverified for me that it is indeed negative option).  I guess that you\ncan argue that there is a right to having a particular insurance, but\nso far I've not come across that up north ... and I take pains to keep\ntabs with news from home.\n\n\nBelieve me, they probably had orgasms when they figured that out.  And\naccording to my sister the yuppie, they pat themselves on the back to\nthe point of ungraciousness at Chamber of Commerce luncheons.\n\n\nI actually have doubts that any new ones have emerged since WW I ...\nno, scratch that ... there are a few in Western Canada, and *quite* \na few in Quebec as part of the post-1980 Quebec Miracle (out with the\nnationalism, in with the French capitalism).  La Groupe des Cooper-\nantes built a new tower by the Eaton('s) store at Les Terraces, and if\nyou were able to catch Urban Angel on CBS's Crimetime you'd see it as\nthe well-lit one with double-turrets at the top.  As for Ontario,\nwhich still dominates and anchors business up north ...\n\nCanada is a very old-money kind of place, and the 1989 Free Trade\nAgreement saw a lot of odd alliances: labour unions and establishment\nold money who wanted to preserve their traditional monopolies on one\nside, and entrepreneurs and internationally oriented businesses and\nprofessionals on the other.  The final Trudeau administration and\nthe first Mulroney government had a high percentage of nouveaux\nriches who knew what it was like to make your own money, and that\nmotivated the McDonald Commission under Trudeau which set up Brian's\ninitiative (Macaroni was against free trade 'til he did a head count\nof his caucus after the 1984 election).\n\n\nWell, you have to realize that in our society that's like saying\nthat \"it's not really national defence\" because you can't hire\nyour own Rambo squad instead or even opting out as a pacifist.\n(BTW, there are always pacifists in the news arguing about their\nportion of taxes, but never people arguing over health insurance\nalternatives ... and we're talking about a press that is hostile\nto whomever is in government, regardless of party; one of their\nfew redeeming characteristics, it seems (-;).\n\n\nThe only way to hit at the Canadian system is transient periods of\nhigh demand, which is more a function of the doctors monopoly's tight\nfist on the licencing.  An obvious difference is that in such a\ntransient period, the rationing is of the nature of a mob battling\nover Cabbage Patch Dolls^TM as we've seen recently as opposed by\nrationing by ability to pay ... but the former is a *transient*\nsituation and if a large body of insured patients were to deluge the\nCalifornia health infrastructure, the same would result --- rationing\namong the insured population.  With smaller markets, there is much\nless flexibility when dealing with our insured population than\nCalifornia (which by the way, has 1/3rd more people than Canada in a\nMUCH more dense area).  So he is correct in that the resources are\nfixed (for a particular time window, or as a function of the doctors\nmonopoly licencing according to the market steady state) in either\ncase.  As for being \"refused treatment\" the government of the day\nwould be shredded to tatters if something like that were to happen;\nCanadians can be geographically bad, too, not realizing that their\nhealth care is private while only their insurance isn't ... too many\npeople have bought into socialist trype that we have socialized\nmedicine.\n\n\nRight, as I've pointed out above ...\n\n\nEither way, the transient situations are hard to deal with since the\nchanges in the private medical care resource take place at a slower\nrate than the ability of people to fall sick esp. in the light of\ndisasters (e.g., Chernobyl) or bad luck (a sudden wave of heart\ndisease). A doctor needs 4-6 years of training, plus internship \nand specialty training.\n\n\nThat's why I've argued for deductible and copayments rather than\neducation, which is what most Canadian fiscal conservatives are\narguing for (the leftists?  \"Ah, just let 'em spend!\" --- yeah,\nright!).  Also, note that only a few provinces cover prescriptions\nunder some high dollar threshold ... in most, it's your private\ninsurance that covers it just like in the U.S.  Still, it all\nadds up in the OECD measures.\n\n\nWe get the Sabres' feed as a replacement game on ESPN tonight (the\nDevils' local metro NY coverage supplants the main ESPN game).\n\n\nYeah, it's a sad story and Saskatchewan Tory leader Grant Devine\nhas been on a nonstop PR campaign to save his sorry butt.  The\nSask NDP have taken a neo-conservative turn like Hawke, Gonzalez\nand Mitterand did.\n\n\nThe medical IRA would have limited use, as you'd need a lower\ncatastrophic threshold else there'd still be a drain on the public\npurse if someone exhausts their IRA.  Also, Singapore has a much\nmore autocratic mentality which has seaped down into its masses\n(if Singaporeans that I've met are any indication ... I don't\nmean any disprespect here) where they'd let you just die.\n\n\nThat's true ... the question is how much leeway is there between\nthe U.S. approach and the second-most capitalist approaches of\nCanada, France and Germany.\n\n\nYes, many ... and pretty close to a lot of smaller towns or not too\nfar from a bigger town.  Just take a look at a detailed atlas ...\nor better, take a flight from Pittsburgh or Rochester to Toronto.\nMy first time across Lake Ontario to NYC, I was amazed by the\nincrease in density ... and the Toronto region is the densest \nin all of Canada.\n\n\nIt's about time!  I've ragged on my own doctor friends as to why they\ndon't invest in their own private practices ... in the end, it's their\nmoney.  But they choose to spend it on America's Cup pipedreams, and\nthat's none of my business.  As for \"provincially owned\" ... for sure\nit's against the law in Canada for governments to be directly involved\nin the provision of health care except in the military or native reser-\nvations.  What that term actually means is that the facility gets by\non public grants to meet shortfall from *lack of use* ... no kidding.\nMedical practice itself is much more conservative up north.  My own\nbest friend did two clerkships at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN,\nand is no stranger to high tech medicine ... but his boat comes first.\n\n\nNo, it's probably socialist whiners who are offended that we have\nprivate practices ... and always have.  They can all take cash\nanyways ... so why not have a particular facility?  The Canadian\nbig government mentality often imagines government where it does\nnot even exist ...\n\nSince the French and Germans have become more entrepreneurial and less\nlaidback without sacrificing their culture and values, then Canadians\ncan do the same.  As I've pointed out above, the law states that it is\nillegal for the *government* to provide any health services except for\nthe military and natives.\n\nLook, nobody stopped the clinic when they planned on the MRI ...\nnobody stopped them when they bought it.  Nobody seems to be stopping\nthem from using it, either.  Much ado about nothing.  Thank goodness\nthat hockey playoffs have started ...\n\n\nI'm certain there is exaggeration somewhere, because the GAO study\nof Canada cited often on USENET did not find access to MRI to be a\nproblem.  I'll bet the doctor is relying on people having listened \nto American trash talk on cable so that he can puff his chest a bit.\nThere are already a few treatment regimens for knee injuries without\nrelying on MRI ... unfortunately, I've had a few. )-;  And I'm not\na banker.

At one extreme was\na man, clearly quite knowledgable about monitors, who said that the\nproblem was that the 13\" monitor's power supply simply couldn't always\nkeep up with sudden changes of the raster image; the rapid change from\na largely light screen to a largely dark one overtaxed the monitor's\npower supply. There was no fix available, he said, because nothing was\nreally wrong. (I guess he meant that the flaw was so fundamental that\nit had to be endured.)\n\nThis seemed quite persuasive and I would have been tempted to\nadopt an attitude of stoicism, except for a reply from a 13\" monitor\nowner who discovered that this very problem is documented in the \nApple Service Technical Procedures, Volume 3, under the heading\nJitter Correction. The section describes a fix involving the replacement\nof a capacitor, the adjustment of a potentiometer, or, failing that,\nthe swap of a circuit board.", "label": 4}

The cesarean rate in the United States is the third highest among \n21 reporting countries, exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico (1). This \nreport presents data on cesarean deliveries from CDC's National Hospital \nDischarge Survey (NHDS) for 1991 and compares these data with previous years. \n     Data on discharges from short-stay, nonfederal hospitals have been \ncollected annually since 1965 in the NHDS, conducted by CDC's National Center \nfor Health Statistics. For 1991, medical and demographic information were \nabstracted from a sample of 274,000 inpatients discharged from 484 \nparticipating hospitals. The 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior \ncesarean (VBAC) presented in this report are based on weighted national \nestimates from the NHDS sample of approximately 31,000 (11%) women discharged \nafter delivery. The estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were \ncalculated by applying cesarean rates from the NHDS to live births from \nnational vital registration data. Therefore, estimates of the number of \ncesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based \nsolely on the NHDS (2). Stated differences in this analysis are significant at \nthe 95% confidence level, based on the two-tailed t-test with a critical value \nof 1.96. \n     In 1991, there were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries, the same rate as \nin 1990 and similar to rates during 1986-1989 (Table 1). The primary cesarean \nrate (i.e., number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no \nprevious cesareans) for 1986-1991 also was stable, ranging from 16.8 to 17.5. \nIn 1991, the cesarean rate in the South was 27.6, significantly (p<0.05) \nhigher than the rates for the West (19.8), Midwest (21.8), and Northeast \n(22.6). Rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years \nthan for younger women; in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or \ngovernment hospitals; in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger \nhospitals; and for deliveries for which Blue Cross/Blue Shield * and other \nprivate insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of \npayment (Table 2). The same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries. \n     Since the early 1970s, the number and percentage of births to older women \nincreased; however, if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained \nthe same as in 1986, the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3, \nessentially the same as the 23.5 observed. \n     Based on the NHDS, of the approximately 4,111,000 live births in 1991, an \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nestimated 966,000 (23.5%) were by cesarean delivery. Of these, an estimated \n338,000 (35.0%) births were repeat cesareans, and 628,000 (65.0%) were primary \ncesareans. Since 1986, approximately 600,000 primary cesareans have been \nperformed annually. In 1986, 8.5% of women who had a previous cesarean \ndelivered vaginally, compared with 24.2% in 1991. Of all cesareans in 1991, \n35.0% were associated with a previous cesarean, 30.4% with dystocia (i.e., \nfailure of labor to progress), 11.7% with breech presentation, 9.2% with fetal \ndistress, and 13.7% with all other specified complications. \n     The average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days. In \ncomparison, the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days, \nand for a repeat cesarean, 4.2 days -- nearly twice the duration for VBAC \ndeliveries (2.2 days) or for vaginal deliveries that were not VBACs (2.3 \ndays). In 1986, the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days, for \nprimary cesareans 5.2 days, for repeat cesareans 4.7 days, and for VBAC and \nnon-VBAC vaginal deliveries 2.7 and 2.6 days, respectively. \n\nReported by: Office of Vital and Health Statistics Systems, National Center \nfor Health Statistics, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The cesarean rate in the United States steadily increased from \n1965 through 1986; however, the findings in this report indicate that rates \nhave been stable since 1986 (3). Because there is little evidence that \nmaternal and child health status has improved during this time and because \ncesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of \nchildbirth, a national health objective for the year 2000 (4) is to reduce the \noverall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary \ncesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries (objective 14.8). \n     Postpartum complications -- including urinary tract and wound infections \n-- may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries \nthan for vaginal births (5). Moreover, the prolonged hospital stays for \ncesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs. For example, in \n1991, the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were $7826 and \n$4720, respectively. The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes \n$611 for physician fees and $2495 for hospital charges (6). If the cesarean \nrate in 1991 had been 15 (the year 2000 objective) instead of 23.5, the number \nof cesarean births would have decreased by 349,000 (617,000 versus 966,000), \nresulting in a savings of more than $1 billion in physician fees and hospital \ncharges. \n     Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since 1986, several factors may \nimpede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean \ndelivery. For example, VBAC rates substantially reflect the number of women \noffered trial of labor, which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 (7). \nOf women who are offered a trial of labor, 50%-70% could deliver vaginally (7) \n--a level already achieved by many hospitals (8). Trial of labor was routinely \noffered in 46% of hospitals surveyed in 1984 (the most recent year for which \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  2\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nnational data are available) (9) when the VBAC rate (according to NHDS data) \nwas 5.7%. The year 2000 objective specifies a VBAC rate of 35%, based on all \nwomen who had a prior cesarean, regardless of whether a trial of labor was \nattempted. To reach the overall cesarean rate goal, however, increases in the \nVBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary \nrate. \n     One hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by \napplying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean \ndelivery, by requiring a second opinion, and by instituting a peer-review \nprocess (10). Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates \ninclude eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing \nreimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries; public dissemination of \nphysician- and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public \nawareness of differences in practices; and addressing malpractice concerns, \nwhich may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean \ndelivery (4). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

During May 1992, the Office of Medical Services, Department of \nState (OMS/DOS), and CDC were notified of an increased number of malaria cases \namong official U.S. personnel stationed in Kampala, Uganda. A review of the \nhealth records from the Embassy Health Unit (EHU) in Kampala indicated that 27 \ncases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from March through June \n1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991. EHU, OMS/DOS, and \nCDC conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and \nidentify potential risk factors for malaria among U.S. Embassy personnel. This \nreport summarizes the results of the investigation. \n     Malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported case-patients were \navailable for review by OMS/DOS and CDC. A case of malaria was confirmed if \nthe slide was positive for Plasmodium sp. Of the 25 persons, 17 were slide-\nconfirmed as having malaria. \n     A questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the EHU to \nobtain information about residence, activities, use of malaria \nchemoprophylaxis, and use of personal protection measures (i.e., using bednets \nand insect repellents, having window and door screens, and wearing long \nsleeves and pants in the evening). Of the 157 persons eligible for the survey, \n128 (82%) responded. \n     Risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in \nKampala. Although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less \nthan or equal to 15 years (6/32 19%) than among persons greater than 15 \nyears (11/94 12%), this difference was not significant (relative risk \nRR=1.6; 95% confidence interval CI=0.6-4.0). Eighty-two percent of the \ncases occurred among persons who had been living in Kampala for 1-5 years, \ncompared with those living there less than 1 year. Travel outside of the \nKampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for \nmalaria. \n     Four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who \nparticipated in the survey: mefloquine, chloroquine and proguanil, chloroquine \nalone, and proguanil alone. In addition, 23 (18%) persons who responded were \nnot using any malaria chemoprophylaxis. The risk for malaria was significantly \nlower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil (8/88 \n9%) than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis (9/37 \n24%) (RR=0.4; 95% CI=0.2-0.9). Twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported \nside effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason. \n     The risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nall or most of the time (2/27 7%) than among persons who sometimes or rarely \nused bednets (15/99 15%) (RR=0.5; 95% CI=0.1-2.0). The risk for malaria was \nalso lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening \n(0/16), compared with those who rarely used repellent (17/110 15%) (RR=0; \nupper 95% confidence limit=1.2). Risk for malaria was not associated with \nfailure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the \nevening. \n     As a result of this investigation, EHU staff reviewed with all personnel \nthe need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis \nregimens. EHU staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection \nmeasures and made plans to obtain insecticide-impregnated bednets and to \nprovide window and door screens for all personnel. \n\nReported by: U.S. Embassy Health Unit, Kampala, Uganda; Office of Medical \nSvcs, Dept of State, Washington, D.C. Malaria Br, Div of Parasitic Diseases, \nNational Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: In Uganda, the increase in malaria among U.S. personnel was \nattributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis \nregimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased \nmalaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub-Saharan \nAfrica. The findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and \ncontinued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in \nmalaria-endemic areas -- preventive measures that are also important for \nshort-term travelers to such areas. \n     Mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in Africa and in most \nother areas with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum; however, in some areas \n(e.g., Thailand), resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness. In \nAfrica, the efficacy of mefloquine, compared with chloroquine alone, in \npreventing infection with P. falciparum is 92% (1 ). Mefloquine is safe and \nwell tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2-year period. The risk \nfor serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis \n(e.g., psychosis and convulsions) is low (i.e., 1.3-1.9 episodes per 100,000 \nusers 2), while the risk for less severe adverse reactions (e.g., dizziness, \ngastrointestinal complaints, and sleep disturbances) is similar to that for \nother antimalarial chemoprophylactics (1). \n     Doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine, but the need \nfor daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen \n(3,4). Chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense \nchloroquine resistance (e.g., Southeast Asia and Africa). In Africa, for \npersons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline, chloroquine and proguanil \nis an alternative, although less effective, regimen. Chloroquine should be \nused for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquine-resistant P. \nfalciparum has not been reported. \n     Country-specific recommendations for preventing malaria and information \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\non the dosage and precautions for malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens are \navailable from Health Information for International Travel, 1992 (i.e., \n\"yellow book\") (5) or 24 hours a day by telephone or fax, (404) 332-4555. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, and \npertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in the \nUnited States since the late 1940s and has been associated with a greater than \n90% reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by these \norganisms. Because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinely \nrecommended for infants, a high priority is the development of combined \nvaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate \ninjections. \n     The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently licensed two new products \nfor vaccinating children against these diseases: 1) the Haemophilus b \nconjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate, ActHIB Trademark), * for \nvaccination against Hib disease only and 2) a combined diphtheria and tetanus \ntoxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Hib conjugate vaccine \n(TETRAMUNE Trademark), a combination of vaccines formulated for use in \nvaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease. \n\n                               ActHIB Trademark \n\n     On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a new Haemophilus b conjugate \nvaccine, polyribosylribitol phosphate-tetanus toxoid conjugate (PRP-T), \nmanufactured by Pasteur Merieux Serum et Vaccins and distributed as ActHIB \nTrademark by Connaught Laboratories, Inc. (Swiftwater, Pennsylvania). This \nvaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three-dose primary \nvaccination series administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. Previously \nunvaccinated infants 7-11 months of age should receive two doses 2 months \napart. Previously unvaccinated children 12-14 months of age should receive one \ndose. A booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all \nchildren. Previously unvaccinated children 15-59 months of age should receive \na single dose and do not require a booster. More than 90% of infants receiving \na primary vaccination series of ActHIB Trademark (consecutive doses at 2, 4, \nand 6 months of age) develop a geometric mean titer of anti-Haemophilus b \npolysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ug/mL (4). This response is similar to \nthat of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed \nHaemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in \nprospective trials. Two U.S. efficacy trials of PRP-T were terminated early \nbecause of the concomitant licensure of other Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  8\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nfor use in infants (4). In these studies, no cases of invasive Hib disease \nwere detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with PRP-T. These and \nother studies suggest that the efficacy of PRP-T vaccine will be similar to \nthat of the other licensed Hib vaccines. TETRAMUNE Trademark \n     On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a combined diphtheria and tetanus \ntoxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Haemophilus b conjugate \nvaccine. TETRAMUNE Trademark, available from Lederle-Praxis Biologicals (Pearl \nRiver, New York), combines two previously licensed products, DTP (TRIIMMUNOL \nRegistered, manufactured by Lederle Laboratories Pearl River, New York) and \nHaemophilus b conjugate vaccine (HibTITER Registered, manufactured by Praxis \nBiologics, Inc. Rochester, New York). \n     This vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months-5 years \nfor protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease when \nindications for vaccination with DTP vaccine and Haemophilus b conjugate \nvaccine coincide. Based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody \nresponses to each of the components of the two vaccines, TETRAMUNE Trademark \nis expected to provide protection against Hib, as well as diphtheria, tetanus, \nand pertussis, equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of other \nDTP and Haemophilus b vaccines. \n     The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that \nall infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed Haemophilus b \nconjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 12-\n15 months (5). The ACIP also recommends that all infants receive a four-dose \nprimary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2, \n4, 6, and 15-18 months of age, and a booster dose at 4-6 years (6-8). A \ncomplete statement regarding recommendations for use of ActHIB Trademark and \nTETRAMUNE Trademark is being developed. \n\nReported by: Office of Vaccines Research and Review, Center for Biologics \nEvaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration.

An international steering committee and scientific \nprogram committee provided guidance. \n     The conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries, including \nAsia, Africa, Europe, Central America, South America, as well as the United \nStates and Canada.  Support tor the workshop was provided by the National \nInstitute of Dental Research, the National Cancer Institute, the National \nInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH Office of AIDS Research, \nand the Procter and Gamble Company. \n     Among the topics discussed were: the epidemiology of HIV lesions; ethics, \nprofessional responsibility, and public policy; occupational issues; provision \nof oral care to the HIV-positive population; salivary HIV transmission and \nmucosal immunity; opportunistic infections; pediatric HIV infection; and \nwomen's issues. \n\n                                Recommendations\n\n     Recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association \nbetween the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of HIV, to \nestablish a universal terminology for HIV-associated oral lesions, to look for \nmore effective treatments for oral manifestations, to expand molecular biology \nstudies to understand the relationship between HIV infection and common oral \nlesions, and to study the effects of HIV therapy on oral lesions. \n\n                                 Epidemiology\n\n     Since the First International Workshop on Oral Manifestations of HIV \nInfection was convened five years ago, the epidemiology of HIV infection has \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nradically changed.  In 1988, HIV infection was detected and reported largely \nin homosexual and bisexual males, intravenous drug users, and hemophiliacs.  \nToday, more HIV infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in \nchildren and adolescents. \n     While the predominant impact of HIV infection has been felt in Africa, a \nmajor increase in infection rate is being seen in Southeast Asia as well.  \nFive hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more \nare appearing all the time. \n     Researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions \nsuch as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis.  They also are beginning to explore \nthe relationships between specific oral lesions and HIV disease progression \nand prognosis. \n\n                            Social/political Issues\n\n     Discussion on the social and political implications of HIV infection \nfocused on changing the public's attitude that AIDS is retribution for \nindiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use.  Speakers also addressed health \ncare delivery for HIV-infected patients, and the need to educate the public \nabout what AIDS is, and how it is acquired. \n\n                          Saliva and Salivary Glands\n\n     Conference speakers described transmission issues and the HIV-inhibitory \nactivity of saliva, the strength of which varies among the different salivary \nsecretions.  Whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular \nsecretions, which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid \nsecretions.  Research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible \nfor salivary inhibitory activity.  They attributed the HIV-inhibitory effect \nof saliva to the 1) aggregation/agglutination of HIV by saliva, which may both \npromote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell, and 2) \ndirect effects on the virus or target cells. \n     Other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease \nin HIV-infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity. \n\n                               Pediatric Issues\n\n     Pediatric AIDS recently has emerged as an area of intense interest.  With \nearly and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment, the life expectancy of HIV-\ninfected children has tripled.  The prevention of transmission of HIV from \nmother to child may be possible in many cases, particularly if the mother's \nsero-status is known prior to giving birth. \n\n                    Periodontal and Gingival Tissue Disease\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 12\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n     Oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases and \ngingivitis found in individuals with HIV infection.  Recommendations made at \nthe workshop include the standardization of terminology, refinement of \ndiagnostic markers, standardization of study design, and proper consideration \nof confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy. \n\n                       Occupational and Treatment Issues\n\n     Occupational issues surrounding the treatment of HIV-infected individuals \nand treatment rendered by HIV-infected health care professionals still command \nconsiderable attention.  Factors under consideration include the cost/benefit \nof HIV testing, patient-to-health care provider transmission of HIV infection \nand the reverse, and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the \ntreatment of HIV-infected patients. \n     Conference participants anticipate that a third International Workshop on \nthe Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection will be held in five years or less.  \nProceedings from the second workshop will be published by the Quintessence \nCompany in late 1993.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--------- end of part 1 ------------\n", "label": 13}

{"text": "Yesterday, I went to the Boeing shareholders meeting.  It was a bit shorter\nthan I expected.  Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big\npresentation on the 777, and other programs.  This year, it was much more\nbare-bones.\n\nIn any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would\nhear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn't get to the mike,\nmaybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed it\nin.\n\nAfter the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written\nquestions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only\nhad monitors downstairs.  Naturally, I was crushed.\n\nSo, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my question\nbeing read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took.\nPresumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all\nthe difference.\n\nSo, on to the substance. The question was \n\nIs Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, such\nas a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing compete\nwith the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed\nby Mcdonnell Douglass?\n\nWell, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me,\nthen he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last\npart first.\n\nThis is to the best of my recollection what he said.\n\nAs far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better\nanswer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers \nabout that.  As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  The High\nspeed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at\nthis point.\n\nSo, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial\narena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that \nthey consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them\nto persue work on their own.\n\nNow, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.  Actually,\nthis is a mis-nomer, as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this\nguy is doing, however, he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space\nlifter contracts.  He won't tell me what he is doing, but maybe this is where\nthe TSTO action is taking place at boeing.  At the very minimum, the chairman\nof the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind, and they are\ntrying to do something with it.  \n\nAnybody know anything further?\nIs this really news?\nDoes this threaten further work on DC-? ?", "label": 14}

{"text": "I have posted a DOS MPEG decoder/player to alt.binaries.pictures.utilities.\n\nHere is a short description and some technical information, taken from the\naccompanying documentation:\n\n\n                              DMPEG V1.0\n\n                       Public Domain MPEG decoder\n\n                           by Stefan Eckart\n\n\n0. Features\n===========\n\nDMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:\n\n\n - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard\n   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)\n\n - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display\n\n - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)\n\n - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale\n\n - color-space selection\n\n - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required\n\n - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)\n\n - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for\n   VGA and many Super-VGAs\n\n...\n\n4. Technical information\n========================\n\nThe player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].\nThe IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]\n(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero\ncoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT\n(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'\nalgorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\ndifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\nalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\nuse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation\ndominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\nthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\n\nRestricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\n+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\nover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\nis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\nexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\n\nSaturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\nsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\nby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\nconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\nlower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than\nto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve\non NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish\nareas.\n\n...\n", "label": 1}

But at the time of the\nRenaissance and Ref ormation in Western Europe man became the centre,\nor the focus of culture (hence \"humanism\"). This consciousness was\nalso secular, in the sense that it was concerned primarily with the\npresent age, r ather than the age to come. Capitalism arose at the\nsame time, and the power of economics became central in philosophy.\nThis doesn't mean that economics did not exist before, simply that it\nbegan to dominate the conscious cultural values of Western European\nsociety and its offshoots. This cultural shift was, in its later\nstages, accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that\njustified\n them.\n\nThere was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of \"economics\" -\nfrom the Christian view of man as the economos, the steward, of\ncreation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces\nand powers. There were denominational differences among the new\nworshippers of Mammon. For some the name of the deity was \"the free\nrein of the market mechanism\", while for others it was \"the\ndialectical forces of history\". But in both the capitalist West and\nthe socialist East the environment was sacrificed on the altar of\nMammon. The situation was mitigated in the West because thos e who\nwere concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom to\noppose what was happening and state their case.\n\nSteve", "label": 15}

{"text": "Heres a story of a Saint that people might like to read. I got it from\na The Morning Star, and am posting it with the permission of the\neditor.\n\n\n    Saint Aloysius Gonzaga\n\n    The Patron of Youth\n\n\n    The marquis Gonzaga had high aspirations for his son, the  Prince\n    Gonzage.  He  wanted  him  to become a famous, brave and honoured\n    soldier. After all, he must carry on the  great  family  name  of\n    Gonzaga.  Of  course, he was to become far more famous, brave and\n    honoured than his father could ever have imagined; though not  in\n    the manner expected.\n\n    Saint Aloysius' mother was a woman who received immense joy  from\n    praying  to  God  and  meditating on the divine mysteries and the\n    life of Our Lord. She had little time for the pleasures  of  this\n    life.  As  Saint  Aloysius\tgrew, he began to resemble his mother\n    more than his father.\n\n    Saint Aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his father's\n    soldiers,  but the moment he discovered that they were vulgar, he\n    fainted from shock. This shows his immense hatred of sin (What an\n    example for us of the contempt we must have for sin).\n\n    About the time of his First Holy  Communion  (which  he  received\n    from  the  Archbishop  of  Milan,  Charles Borromeo, whom himself\n    became a great Saint), he con-secrated  his  purity  to  God  and\n    asked the Blessed Virgin to protect his innocence for life.\n\n    He wanted to share Our Lord's suffering to\tshow  his  reciprocal\n    love.  He  started by denying his passions; he avoided eating the\n    finest foods, wearing the best clothes, and would put  pieces  of\n    wood  in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of God.\n    While he was in his early teens his  father  sent  him  (and  his\n    younger  brother)  to  the court of the Spanish King, Phillip 11.\n    Obediently, he set out to make the best of it. He mixed  in  well\n    with  the people of the royal court, for he was handsome, polite,\n    intelligent and always had something interesting to say.\n\n\n    Not long before this time, the great soldier-saint,  Saint\tIgna-\n    tius  of  Loyola,  had founded the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits)\n    towards which Saint Aloysius\n\n\n\t\t\t\t  -12-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    began to have a yearning. When he finally told  his  father,  the\n    marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest.\n\n    After a short time, his father sent him to the  great  cities  in\n    order that he be tempted away from the priesthood, but even\n\n    through these trials, Saint Aloysius grew in his desire  for  the\n    religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity.\n\n    The Marquis' plans were obviously failing, so he con-fronted  his\n    son:  \"Will  you or will you not obey me and forget this foolish-\n    ness?\" \"I will not, father,\" was the  in-evitable  reply.\t\"Then\n    leave from my sight and don't return until you change your mind!\"\n    With tears clouding his eyes, the Saint left the  room  to\tpray:\n    \"Tell  me Lord, what am I to do? Tell me! Tell me!\" He knelt down\n    to flagellate himself as he had done several  times  before,  but\n    this  time\the was seen. The onlooker rushed to the marquis. This\n    at last brought the proud man to his senses. \"The Lord wants him,\n    the Lord can have him.\" He gave his consent for his son to become\n    a Jesuit.\n\n    After some years (at the end of the sixteenth century), a  terri-\n    ble  epidemic  broke out in Rome. All the hospitals were full and\n    could house no more, so the Jesuits opened their own. Saint Aloy-\n    sius  did  all he could in the hospitals, particularly to prepare\n    the dying for a holy death.\n\n    Saint Aloysius himself contracted the plague  from\tcarrying  and\n    nursing  the  sick.

{"text": "\nLooking at [1] we find that during Roman times \"Tyre vied with Sidon\nfor first place in the intellectual life of the period\"; that Tyre was\nthe seat of a Christian bishop, eventually with 14 dioceses under it;\nthat \"the most magnificent church of its kind in all Phoenecia\" was the\nbasilica built in Tyre ca. 314; that Tyre was well known for its\nexports of glassware, wine, white marble, and dyed cloth; that Tyre,\nalong with other seaports, \"provided outlets for South Arabian, Indian\nand even Chinese trade\"; that Tyre had to accomodate its growing\npopulation by \"following a perpendicular, rather than horizontal, line\nof growth\" (because it was running out of land to build on); that Tyre\nestablished colonies of its own.  None of this sounds like a \"small\nfishing village\" by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nCenturies later, under the Abbasids, Tyre had \"opulent and flourishing\nbazaars\" and buildings of 5-6 stories.  During this period, Tyre was\n\"noted for its export of sugar, beads, and, as of old, glassware.\"\nDuring the Crusades, Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held\nby Franks.  (There is a lot more, but I got tired of writing.)\n\nIn [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon: \"other\n*major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek and\nZahlah.\"  [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact of\nthe Lebanese Civil War, and the Israeli military actions (1978, 1982)\non the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel's\nwithdrawel in 1984, \"Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local\neconomy.\"\n\nIf Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present,\nwhy is it always called a city (or, above, a \"major city\")?  Why\ndoes it show up on all the maps?   When population figures for cities\nin Lebanon are given, why is Tyre always one of the cities on the\nlist (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?\n\n[1] Philip K. Hitti, _Lebanon in History: From the earliest times to\nthe present_, NY, St. Martins, 1967.  \n\n[2] Federal Research Division, Library of Congress, _Lebanon: a\ncountry study_, edited by Thomas Collelo, 1989.\n\n\nA one-horse town?  Sounds like a lot of work for one horse.\n(Anyway, Tyre is connected by roads to the mainland.  They\nmay even use cars these days. :-) \n\nThe 1991 Encyclopedia Britannica says \"Pop. (1982 est.) 23,000.\"  \nMost other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range.\n(One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000; the same\nsource give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut, also,\nso I doubt that it is a typo.  Perhaps these were figures for\nthe cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don't doubt that the\npopulation of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  In\nparticular, the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.   \n\n\nI thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed.\nDon't most, if not all, of these apply not just to Tyre but to \nthe other cities in the area?  Sidon, for example?  Can you make\na case for Tyre having been singled out?\n\n\nThey had a good deal of autonomy under the Seleucids. From [2]:\nTyre \"receiv[ed] the rights [of autonomy] from Antiochus Ephiphanes\nand from 125 BC onward enjoy[ed] complete autonomy. She started a\nlarge series of coins, occasionally in gold ...\"\n\nThe descriptions of Tyre under the Romans don't seem to fit\nyour characterization, either.  And under the Abbasids it seems\nto have been allowed to flourish.  I still think you are stretching\nwhen you try to describe Tyre as having been nothing but a small\nfishing village.\n\n\nA Christian apologist whose standards of scholarship are quite low.\nHe happens to quote the same source you quote (Nina Jidejian,\n_Tyre through the Ages_, Beirut, Dar El-Mashreq Publishers, 1969).\nThe same sentence, in fact.

{"text": "From article <1r0mhtINNa59@cronkite.Central.Sun.COM>, by dbernard@clesun.Central.Sun.COM (Dave Bernard):\n\nI noticed that too.  Special agent (asshole actually) Ricks stated that\nDavid Koresh had \"explosives that could blow up an armored vehicle 40\nfeet into the air.\"  It looked like to me that the BDs had plenty of\nopportunity to use these explosives---provided that they had them in the\nfirst place.  For example, when one of the tanks was injecting CS gas\ninto the ranch house (yes ranch house; the BDs weren't living in a\nfortress) they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because\nit was idling there for a considerable length of time.  So, why didn't\nthey do this?  Could it be that they didn't have any explosives or\nsimilar munitions?  I just don't buy what the ATF and FBI have been\nsaying.  Hopefully, the truth will come out.\n\nHere's something noteworthy:  after the fire had been burning for some\ntime an explosion occurred---just *one* explosion.  The media said that\nthis was some of the explosives that the BDs posessed going off.  I\ndon't think this was the case.  My brother and I noticed that this\nso-called \"explosion\" resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited.\nWe figure that this is what it was because of how the \"explosion\"\nlooked and sounded.  Obviously, it wasn't due to something like TNT,\ndynamite, or C4.  I have seen a propane explosion before...the explosion\nin the ranch house greatly resembled this.  Also, I noticed something\nthat looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day.\n\nIsn't it curious that the ATF wasn't very forthcoming about how the four\nofficers got killed?  Many weeks had gone by before they stated that\nsome of the officers had been killed and/or wounded by grenades thrown\nby the BDs.  Earlier, when someone asked one of the spokespersons about\nwhether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents, they\nsaid that an autopsy had been done but THEY WEREN'T READY TO RELEASE\nTHE FINDINGS.  Now why is this?  Does the ATF have something to hide?\nPerhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire.  What is the\ncause of death exactly?  NO ONE HAS EVER SAID WHAT IT IS.\n\nWhat is certain is this:  ATF agents *did* throw grenades into the\ncompound.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Koresh handed his lawyer a grenade\nbody during one of the lawyer's visits to the compound.  Later on\nthe lawyer gave the grenade body (I don't know if it was a dud or a\nspent one btw) to the ATF.  How much do you want to bet that this\ngrenade will mysteriously disappear?  At this point in time the only\npeople we know who had grenades was the ATF agents.  Wouldn't it be\na shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades, rockets,\nor explosives in the rubble?  The ATF would sure have egg on their\nface then.  Note that the ATF is doing the *initial* sweep of the\nrubble.  The FBI and the Texas Rangers won't investigate until the\nATF is done.  This looks like a perfect opportunity for the ATF to\nmake sure that others \"find\" what they want for them to \"find\" if\nyou know what I mean.  I'm probably being a little paranoid here\nbut if I am I have could reason to be.  Recall that several weeks\nhad gone by before anyone said that the BDs had used grenades.\nAlso recall that early on the ATF had *denied* that their agents\nused grenades on the BDs.

{"text": "\nEvery city and suburban police officer I've seen around the Twin Cities in the\nlast two years has carried a semi-auto of some type (different brands though\nI haven't seen any Glock's). \n\nWith regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual\nrantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I'd like to put my two\ncents worth in.  While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a \nlarge frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to\nsemi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know, some people can't stand\nhim and think he's full of bull, but I think that in general his material is\nvery valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something \nlike that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that\n\"different is good\".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in \nmore accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a\ncertain \"propriatory nature\" of each gun that takes some familiarity to \nlearn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar\nwith different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least\nslowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.\n\n\nYes, but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you either\npull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi\nauto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.\n\n\n\nI'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA\nsemi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same\nround - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will\nalways go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud\nbut what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare, but your round will\nnow go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide\non a misfire takes very little time.\n\n\n\nActually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not\nnecessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and\nat the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the\nround to set it off.\n\n\nThe best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed\nloaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two\nhanded job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that\nwhile you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the\ngun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always \ntake more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing\na partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can\nstill be used if needed later).  \n\n\nYes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear\nit.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire\nwith factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto\nbut even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).\n\n\n\n\nAll common semi-auto's can be carried with a round in their chamber without any\nsafety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should\nsay that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it's\nno different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing\npin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantage\ncarrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed\nof employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'm\nnot familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was\ninitially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining\nthe design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and \nshooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in\na thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets\nyou more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.\n\n\nYeah, the infamous Glock.  I still can't figure out how it's worse than a revolver\nfor safety.  If you don't pull the trigger it doesn't go off.  I imagine that if all\nyour revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger\nfar enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that\nnasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and\nrelying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew\noff your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there.\n\n\nI think this is even okay for a riot (as long as it's a small one B^)).\n\n\nI have the poor man's Beretta (Taurus 99) and consider it inferior as a carry\nweapon to the Springfield .45 (oops, 9mm vs. 45 arguments are relegated to\nr.g).  You are right, though.  If you don't hit what you aim at then the\nshooter/gun combination has failed.  I don't ascribe failures in the the\nfire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun.  This is\na shooter failure, whether through lack of discipline or lack of training.\n\n\n\n9mm's are becoming more popular with crooks too, though the .38 does still\nlead the list.  And like I said, around here semi-auto's seem the rule for the\nstreet cop.  Don't know about the State Patrol however, they may still carry\nthe \"Highway Patrolman\".\n\n\nVincent, please don't take any of this as a flame.  Just my $0.02 (whoops, looks more\nlike $2.00) worth.  And much of it is IMHO, but do check Ayoob's book.", "label": 16}

The uVAX 32\nsubsetted the architecture onto a single chip and used a software\nemulator for these very complex instructions, the full VLSI uVAX\nincluded the entire instruction set, was 5-10 times more copmlex but\nonly ranm 20% faster.\n\nCPU\t\tChips\tMicrocode\tTransistors\n---\t\t-----\t---------\t-----------\nuVAX 32\t\t2\t64K\t\t101K\nVLSI uVAX\t9\t480K\t\t1250K\n", "label": 2}

{"text": "I would like to apologize for the typos in the previous post.\n\nIn retrospect I would also like to quote another source: Douglas C.\nHaldeman from his 1991 book _Homosexuality_\n\nTHERAPY INEFFECTIVE\n\nRecently the founders of yet another prominent \"ex-gay\" ministry, Exodus\nInternational, denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective.\nMichael Busse and Gary Cooper, cofounders of Exodus International and lovers\nfor 13 years, were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979.  The\nprogram was described by these men as \"ineffective . . . not one person was\nhealed.\"  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent\nfeelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were\ndriven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed \"reparative therapy.\"\n\nThe previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June\n30, 1992 called \"The Ex-Ex-Gay\" by Robert Pela.\n\nSome personal thoughts:\n\nIt is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major\nportion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among\nits ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all\nthey required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to\nsave their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even\nlater, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and\nsegragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings.\nToday's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is\nstill coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind\ncontrol, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than\nGod sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt\nthier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is \"physically\" forced\nto stay in this \"reparative therapy\" but sheer social pressure is enough for\nmany to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.\n\nAs an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution\nagainst gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by\nthe contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live,\nnot by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven';t\na clue what is in their heart.\n\nFor those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept them\nplease contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG (Parents & Friends of Lesbians\nAnd Gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.  This is a group of\npeople comprised of Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals, their parents and friends\nwho have formed a support group for help and understanding.  Try talking to\na parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some \"first-hand\" real life and\nloving understanding.  God's love and understanding for Gay people is no\nless abundant.", "label": 19}

{"text": "\nHere again, the problem with most of the individuals posting here, you take the\nbiblical account as though it were some sort of historical recounting in the\nmodern sense.  I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross That\nSpoke_ (Pub. Harper and Row, 1988).  The earliest texts which we have make no\nreference to an empty tomb.  Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of\nresurrection. Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what\nthe point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg's work \n_Resurrection, Immortality, and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ (Publ\nCambridge, Havard Univ. Press, 1972) is most helpful.  Look At Rom 1:1-3.  Paul\nhere has no need of an empty tomb.  Additionally in 1 Cor 15, Here again there\nis no mention of an empty tomb. He was raised (note the passive), he appeared,\nno ascension either.\n\nResurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the\ngrave.  The whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our texts\nuntil well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming up\nwith a body would have been ludicrious.  Moreover Mack has argued (convicingly,\nI think) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark (we have no texts\nbefore this which mention the tomb). \n    \n\n\nYou are quite right here.  Even the Idea of a subjective mystical event as the\nfoundation of the resurrection narratives is currently becoming more untenable.\nSee B. Mack _A Myth of Innocence_.", "label": 15}
